https://www.certshero.com 

(Select TWO.) 
A. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for the EC2 instances 
B. VPC subnet ACLs to check the health of a service 
C. Resources that are distributed across multiple Availability Zones 
D. Configuration of AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS) to move the EC2 instances to a different AWS Region 
E. Resources that are distributed across multiple AWS points of presence 

Answer: A, C 
Explanation: 
The correct answers are A and C because Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and resources that are distributed across multiple Availability Zones are AWS services and features that will improve availability and reduce the impact of failures for the web application. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is a service that enables users to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances in response to changes in demand or performance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps users to maintain optimal availability and performance of their applications by adding or removing instances as needed. Resources that are distributed across multiple Availability Zones are AWS features that enable users to increase the fault tolerance and resilience of their applications. Availability Zones are isolated locations within an AWS Region that have independent power, cooling, and networking. Users can launch their resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones to protect their applications from the failure of a single location. The other options are incorrect because they are not AWS services and features that will improve availability and reduce the impact of failures for the web application. VPC subnet ACLs are AWS features that enable users to control the inbound and outbound traffic to and from their subnets within a VPC. VPC subnet ACLs do not check the health of a service, but rather filter the network traffic based on rules. Configuration of AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS) is an AWS service that enables users to migrate their on-premises servers to AWS. Configuration of AWS SMS does not help to move the Amazon EC2 instances to a different AWS Region, but rather to migrate the servers from the source environment to AWS. Resources that are distributed across multiple AWS points of presence are AWS features that enable users to deliver content to their end users with low latency and high performance.

Question: 70 
An Availability Zone consists of: 
A. one or more data centers in a single location. 
B. two or more data centers in multiple locations. 
C. one or more physical hosts in a single data center. 
D. two or more physical hosts in multiple data centers. 
Answer: A 
https://www.certshero.com 

Explanation: 
The correct answer is A because an Availability Zone consists of one or more data centers in a single location. An Availability Zone is an isolated location within an AWS Region that has independent power, cooling, and networking. Each Availability Zone has one or more data centers that host the physical servers and storage devices that run the AWS services. The other options are incorrect because they are not accurate descriptions of an Availability Zone. Two or more data centers in multiple locations are not an Availability Zone, but rather multiple Availability Zones within an AWS Region. One or more physical hosts in a single data center are not an Availability Zone, but rather the components of a data center within an Availability Zone. Two or more physical hosts in multiple data centers are not an Availability Zone, but rather the components of multiple data centers within one or more Availability Zones. Reference: [Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones] 

Question: 71 
A company wants to ensure that two Amazon EC2 instances are in separate data centers with minimal communication latency between the data centers. How can the company meet this requirement? 
A. Place the EC2 instances in two separate AWS Regions connected with a VPC peering connection. 
B. Place the EC2 instances in two separate Availability Zones within the same AWS Region. 
C. Place one EC2 instance on premises and the other in an AWS Region. Then connect them by using an AWS VPN connection. 
D. Place both EC2 instances in a placement group for dedicated bandwidth. 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The correct answer is B because placing the EC2 instances in two separate Availability Zones within the same AWS Region is the best way to meet the requirement. Availability Zones are isolated locations within an AWS Region that have independent power, cooling, and networking. Users can launch their resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones to increase the fault tolerance and resilience of their applications. Availability Zones within the same AWS Region are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. The other options are incorrect because they are not the best ways to meet the requirement. Placing the EC2 instances in two separate AWS Regions connected with a VPC peering connection is not the best way to meet the requirement because AWS Regions are geographically dispersed and may have higher communication latency between them than Availability Zones within the same AWS Region. VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables users to route traffic between them using private IP addresses. Placing one EC2 instance on premises and the other in an AWS Region, and then connecting them by using an AWS VPN connection is not the best way to meet the requirement because on-premises and AWS Region are geographically dispersed and may have higher communication latency between them than Availability Zones within the same AWS Region. AWS VPN connection is a secure and encrypted connection between a user・s network and their VPC. Placing both EC2 instances in a placement group for dedicated bandwidth is not the best way to meet the requirement because a placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single 
https://www.certshero.com 

Availability Zone that enables users to launch instances with specific performance characteristics. A placement group does not ensure that the instances are in separate data centers, and it does not provide low-latency communication between instances in different Availability Zones.

Question: 74 
Which of the following are AWS Cloud design principles? (Select TWO.) 
A. Pay for compute resources in advance. 
B. Make data-driven decisions to determine cloud architectural design. 
C. Emphasize manual processes to allow for changes. 
D. Test systems at production scale. 
E. Refine operational procedures infrequently. 

Answer: B, D 
Explanation: 
The correct answers are B and D because making data-driven decisions to determine cloud architectural design and testing systems at production scale are AWS Cloud design principles. Making data-driven decisions to determine cloud architectural design means that users should collect and analyze data from their AWS resources and applications to optimize their performance, availability, security, and cost. Testing systems at production scale means that users should simulate real-world scenarios and load conditions to validate the functionality, reliability, and scalability of their systems. The other options are incorrect because they are not AWS Cloud design principles. Paying for compute resources in advance means that users have to invest heavily in data centers and servers before they know how they will use them. This is not a cloud design principle, but rather a traditional IT model. Emphasizing manual processes to allow for changes means that users have to rely on human intervention and coordination to perform operational tasks and updates. This is not a cloud design principle, but rather a source of inefficiency and error. Refining operational procedures infrequently means that users have to stick to the same methods and practices without adapting to the changing needs and feedback. This is not a cloud design principle, but rather a hindrance to innovation and improvement. Reference: AWS

Learning to improve from operational failures is a design principle of the operational excellence pillar, which focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continually improve supporting processes and procedures. The other options are incorrect because they are not recommended design principles of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Reducing downtime by making infrastructure changes infrequently and in large increments is not a design principle of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, but rather a source of risk and inefficiency. A well-architected system should implement changes frequently and in small increments to minimize the impact and scope of failures. Investing the time to configure infrastructure manually is not a design principle of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, but rather a source of human error and inconsistency. A well-architected system should automate manual tasks to improve the speed and accuracy of operations. Using monolithic application design for centralization is not a design principle of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, but rather a source of complexity and rigidity. A well-architected system should use loosely coupled and distributed components to enable scalability and resilience. Reference: [AWS Well-Architected Framework]

Using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to break down a monolithic architecture into microservices is an example of: 
A. a loosely coupled architecture. 
B. a tightly coupled architecture. 
C. a stateless architecture. 
D. a stateful architecture. 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to break down a monolithic architecture into microservices is an example of a loosely coupled architecture. A loosely coupled architecture is one where the components are independent and can communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces. This allows for greater scalability, flexibility, and resilience. A tightly coupled architecture is one where the components are interdependent and rely on each other for functionality. This can lead to increased complexity, fragility, and difficulty in changing or scaling the system. Amazon

C. Use automation to recover immediately from failure. 
D. Rightsize Amazon EC2 instances to ensure optimal performance. 
E. Simulate failures to test recovery processes. 

Answer: C, E 
Explanation: 
The design principles for reliability in the AWS Cloud are: Test recovery procedures. The best way to ensure that systems can recover from failures is to regularly test them using simulated scenarios. This can help identify gaps and improve the recovery process. 
https://www.certshero.com 

Automatically recover from failure. By using automation, systems can detect and correct failures without human intervention. This can reduce the impact and duration of failures and improve the availability of the system. Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability. By adding more redundant resources to the system, the impact of individual resource failures can be reduced. This can also improve the performance and scalability of the system. Stop guessing capacity. By using monitoring and automation, systems can adjust the capacity based on the demand and performance metrics. This can prevent failures due to insufficient or excessive capacity and optimize the cost and efficiency of the system. Manage change in automation. By using automation, changes to the system can be applied in a consistent and controlled manner. This can reduce the risk of human errors and configuration drifts that can cause failures. AWS

A company's information security manager is supervising a move to AWS and wants to ensure that AWS best practices are followed. The manager has concerns about the potential misuse of AWS account root user credentials. Which of the following is an AWS best practice for using the AWS account root user credentials? 
A. Allow only the manager to use the account root user credentials for normal activities. 
B. Use the account root user credentials only for Amazon EC2 instances from the AWS Free Tier. 
C. Use the account root user credentials only when they alone must be used to perform a required function. 
D. Use the account root user credentials only for the creation of private VPC subnets. 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The AWS best practice for using the AWS account root user credentials is to use them only when they alone must be used to perform a required function. The AWS account root user credentials have full access to all the resources in the account, and therefore pose a security risk if compromised or misused. You should create individual IAM users with the minimum necessary permissions for everyday tasks, and use AWS Organizations to manage multiple accounts. You should also enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) and rotate the password for the root user regularly. Some of the functions that require the root user credentials are changing the account name, closing the account, changing the support plan, and restoring an IAM user・s access. 

Question: 148 
A company needs to store data across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS Region. The data will not be accessed regularly but must be immediately retrievable. Which Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage class meets these requirements MOST cost effectively? 
A. EFS Standard 
B. EFS Standard-Infrequent Access(EFS Standard-IA) 
C. EFS One Zone 
D. EFS One Zone-Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone-IA) 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (EFS Standard-IA) is the storage class that meets the requirements of storing data across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS Region, that will not be accessed regularly but must be immediately retrievable, most cost-effectively. EFS Standard-IA is designed for files that are accessed less frequently, but still require the same high performance, low latency, and high availability as EFS Standard. EFS Standard-IA has a lower storage cost than EFS Standard, but charges a small additional fee for each access. EFS One Zone and EFS One Zone-IA store data in a single Availability Zone, which reduces the availability and durability compared to EFS Standard and EFS

Question: 149 
A company wants to establish a security layer in its VPC that will act as a firewall to control subnet traffic. Which AWS service or feature will meet this requirement? 
A. Routing tables 
B. Network access control lists (network ACLs) 
C. Security groups 
D. Amazon GuardDuty 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Security groups are the service or feature that meets the requirement of establishing a security layer in a VPC that will act as a firewall to control subnet traffic. Security groups are stateful firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. You can assign one or more security groups to each instance in a VPC, and specify the rules that allow or deny traffic based on the protocol, port, and source or destination. Security groups are associated with network interfaces, and therefore apply to all the instances in the subnets that use those network interfaces. Routing tables are used to direct traffic between subnets and gateways, not to filter traffic. Network ACLs are stateless firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level, but they are less granular and more cumbersome to manage than security groups. Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors your AWS account and workloads for malicious or unauthorized activity, not a firewall service. 

Question: 150 
A newly created IAM user has no IAM policy attached. What will happen when the user logs in and attempts to view the AWS resources in the account? 
A. All AWS services will be read-only access by default. 
B. Access to all AWS resources will be denied. 
C. Access to the AWS billing services will be allowed. 
D. Access to AWS resources will be allowed through the AWS CLL 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Access to all AWS resources will be denied if a newly created IAM user has no IAM policy attached and logs in and attempts to view the AWS resources in the account. IAM policies are the way to grant permissions to IAM users, groups, and roles to access and manage AWS resources. By default, IAM users have no permissions, unless they are explicitly granted by an IAM policy. Therefore, a newly created IAM user without any IAM policy attached will not be able to view or perform any actions on the AWS resources in the account. Access to the AWS billing services and AWS CLI will also be

Question: 186 
Which task can a company perform by using security groups in the AWS Cloud? 
A. Allow access to an Amazon EC2 instance through only a specific port. 
B. Deny access to malicious IP addresses at a subnet level. 
C. Protect data that is cached by Amazon CloudFront. 
D. Apply a stateless firewall to an Amazon EC2 instance. 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Security groups are virtual firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic for Amazon EC2 instances. They can be used to allow access to an Amazon EC2 instance through only a specific port, such as port 22 for SSH or port 80 for HTTP. Security groups cannot deny access to malicious IP addresses at a subnet level, as they only allow or deny traffic based on the rules defined by the customer. To block malicious IP addresses, customers can use network ACLs, which are stateless firewalls that can be applied to subnets. Security groups cannot protect data that is cached by Amazon CloudFront, as they only apply to EC2 instances. To protect data that is cached by Amazon CloudFront, customers can use encryption, signed URLs, or signed cookies. Security groups are not stateless firewalls, as they track the state of the traffic and automatically allow the response traffic to flow back to the source. Stateless firewalls do not track the state of the traffic and require rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.

Question: 190 
A company wants its Amazon EC2 instances to share the same geographic area but use redundant underlying power sources. Which solution will meet these requirements? 
A. Use EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones in the same AWS Region. 
B. Use Amazon CloudFront as the database for the EC2 instances. 
C. Use EC2 instances in the same edge location and the same Availability Zone. 
D. Use EC2 instances in AWS OpsWorks stacks in different AWS Regions. 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Using EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones in the same AWS Region is a solution that meets the requirements of sharing the same geographic area but using redundant underlying power sources. Availability Zones are isolated locations within an AWS Region that have independent power, cooling, and physical security. They are connected through low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. By launching EC2 instances in different Availability Zones, users can increase the fault tolerance and availability of their applications. Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that speeds up the delivery of web content and media to end users 
https://www.certshero.com 

by caching it at the edge locations closer to them. It is not a database service and cannot be used to store operational data for EC2 instances. Edge locations are sites that are part of the Amazon CloudFront network and are located in many cities around the world. They are not the same as Availability Zones and do not provide redundancy for EC2 instances. AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that allows users to automate the deployment and management of applications using Chef or Puppet. It can be used to create stacks that span multiple AWS Regions, but this would not meet the requirement of sharing the same geographic area.

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Amazon CloudFront is the AWS service that offers a global content delivery network (CDN) that helps companies securely deliver websites, videos, applications, and APIs at high speeds with low 
https://www.certshero.com 

latency. Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of static and dynamic web content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files, to users. Amazon CloudFront uses a global network of edge locations, located near users・ geographic locations, to cache and serve content with high availability and performance. Amazon CloudFront also provides features such as AWS Shield for DDoS protection, AWS Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS encryption, AWS WAF for web application firewall, and AWS Lambda@Edge for customizing content delivery with serverless code. Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudFormation are not services that offer a global CDN. Amazon EC2 is a service that provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon CloudWatch is a service that provides monitoring and observability for AWS resources and applications. AWS CloudFormation is a service that provides a common language to model and provision AWS resources and their dependencies. 

Question: 208 
Which benefit of AWS Cloud computing provides lower latency between users and applications? 
A. Agility 
B. Economies of scale 
C. Global reach 
D. Pay-as-you-go pricing 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Global reach is the benefit of AWS Cloud computing that provides lower latency between users and applications. Global reach means that AWS customers can deploy their applications and data in multiple regions around the world, and deliver them to users with high performance and availability. AWS has the largest global infrastructure of any cloud provider, with 25 geographic regions and 81 Availability Zones, as well as 216 Points of Presence in 84 cities across 42 countries. Customers can choose the optimal locations for their applications and data based on their business requirements, such as compliance, data sovereignty, and customer proximity. Agility, economies of scale, and pay-as-you-go pricing are other benefits of AWS Cloud computing, but they do not directly provide lower latency between users and applications. Agility means that AWS customers can quickly and easily provision and scale up or down AWS resources as needed, without upfront costs or long-term commitments. Economies of scale means that AWS customers can benefit from the lower costs and higher efficiency that AWS achieves by operating at a massive scale and passing the savings to the customers. Pay-as-you-go pricing means that AWS customers only pay for the AWS resources they use, without any upfront costs or long-term contracts. 

Question: 209 
Which design principles should a company apply to AWS Cloud workloads to maximize sustainability and minimize environmental impact? (Select TWO.) 
A. Maximize utilization of Amazon EC2 instances. 
B. Minimize utilization of Amazon EC2 instances. 
C. Minimize usage of managed services. 
https://www.certshero.com 

D. Force frequent application reinstallations by users. 
E. Reduce the need for users to reinstall applications. 

Answer: A, E 
Explanation: 
To maximize sustainability and minimize environmental impact, a company should apply the following design principles to AWS Cloud workloads: maximize utilization of Amazon EC2 instances and reduce the need for users to reinstall applications. Maximizing utilization of Amazon EC2 instances means that the company can optimize the performance and efficiency of their compute resources, and avoid wasting energy and money on idle or underutilized instances. The company can use features such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, and AWS Compute Optimizer to automatically adjust the number and type of instances based on demand, cost, and performance. Reducing the need for users to reinstall applications means that the company can minimize the amount of data and bandwidth required to deliver their applications to users, and avoid unnecessary downloads and updates that consume energy and resources. The company can use services such as Amazon CloudFront, AWS AppStream 2.0, and AWS Amplify to deliver their applications faster, more securely, and more efficiently to users across the globe. Minimizing utilization of Amazon EC2 instances, minimizing usage of managed services, and forcing frequent application reinstallations by users are not design principles that would maximize sustainability and minimize environmental impact. Minimizing utilization of Amazon EC2 instances would reduce the performance and efficiency of the compute resources, and potentially increase the costs and complexity of the cloud workloads. Minimizing usage of managed services would increase the operational overhead and responsibility of the company, and potentially expose them to more security and reliability risks. Forcing frequent application reinstallations by users would increase the amount of data and bandwidth required to deliver the applications to users, and potentially degrade the user experience and satisfaction. 

Question: 210 
An ecommerce company wants to design a highly available application that will be hosted on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. How should the company deploy the EC2 instances to meet these requirements? 
A. Across multiple edge locations 
B. Across multiple VPCs 
C. Across multiple Availability Zones 
D. Across multiple AWS accounts 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The company should deploy the EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones to design a highly available application. Availability Zones are isolated locations within an AWS Region that are engineered to be fault-tolerant and operate independently of each other. By deploying the EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones, the company can ensure that their application can withstand the failure of an entire Availability Zone and continue to operate with minimal disruption. 
https://www.certshero.com 

Deploying the EC2 instances across multiple edge locations, VPCs, or AWS accounts will not provide the same level of availability and fault tolerance as Availability Zones. Edge locations are part of the Amazon CloudFront service, which is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches and serves web content to users. VPCs are virtual networks that isolate the AWS resources within an AWS Region. AWS

Question: 211 
Which AWS Cloud design principle does a company follow by using AWS CloudTrail? 
A. Recover automatically. 
B. Perform operations as code. 
C. Measure efficiency. 
D. Ensure traceability. 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
The company follows the AWS Cloud design principle of ensuring traceability by using AWS CloudTrail. AWS CloudTrail is a service that records the API calls and events made by or on behalf of the AWS account. The company can use AWS CloudTrail to monitor, audit, and analyze the activity and changes in their AWS resources and applications. AWS CloudTrail helps the company to achieve compliance, security, governance, and operational efficiency. Recovering automatically, performing operations as code, and measuring efficiency are other AWS Cloud design principles, but they are not directly related to using AWS CloudTrail. Recovering automatically means that the company can design their cloud workloads to handle failures gracefully and resume normal operations without manual intervention. Performing operations as code means that the company can automate the creation, configuration, and management of their cloud resources using scripts or templates. Measuring 
efficiency 
means 
that 
the 
company 
can 
monitor 
and 
optimize

Question: 212 
A company wants to move its data warehouse application to the AWS Cloud. The company wants to run and scale its analytics services without needing to provision and manage data warehouse clusters. Which AWS service will meet these requirements? 
A. Amazon Redshift provisioned data warehouse 
B. Amazon Redshift Serverless 
C. Amazon Athena D. Amazon S3 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Amazon Redshift Serverless is the AWS service that will meet the requirements of the company that 
https://www.certshero.com 

wants to move its data warehouse application to the AWS Cloud and run and scale its analytics services without needing to provision and manage data warehouse clusters. Amazon Redshift Serverless is a new feature of Amazon Redshift, which is a fully managed data warehouse service that allows customers to run complex queries and analytics on large volumes of structured and semi-structured data. Amazon Redshift Serverless automatically scales the compute and storage resources based on the workload demand, and customers only pay for the resources they consume. Amazon Redshift Serverless also simplifies the management and maintenance of the data warehouse, as customers do not need to worry about choosing the right cluster size, resizing the cluster, or distributing the data across the nodes. Amazon Redshift provisioned data warehouse, Amazon Athena, and Amazon S3 are not the best services to meet the requirements of the company. Amazon Redshift provisioned data warehouse requires customers to choose the number and type of nodes for their cluster, and manually resize the cluster if their workload changes. Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that allows customers to analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL, but it is not a data warehouse service that can store and organize the data. Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service that can store any amount and type of data, but it is not a data warehouse service that can run complex queries and analytics on the data. 

Question: 213 
Which tasks are the responsibility of AWS according to the AWS shared responsibility model? (Select TWO.) 
A. Configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). 
B. Configure security groups on Amazon EC2 instances. 
C. Secure the access of physical AWS facilities. 
D. Patch applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances. 
E. Perform infrastructure patching and maintenance. 

Answer: C, E 
Explanation: 
The tasks that are the responsibility of AWS according to the AWS shared responsibility model are securing the access of physical AWS facilities and performing infrastructure patching and maintenance. The AWS shared responsibility model defines the division of responsibilities between AWS and the customer for security and compliance. AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, which includes the physical security of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the AWS services. AWS is also responsible for the maintenance and patching of the infrastructure that supports the AWS services. The customer is responsible for the security in the cloud, which includes the configuration and management of the AWS resources and applications that they use. Configuring AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), configuring security groups on Amazon EC2 instances, and patching applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances are tasks that are the responsibility of the customer, not AWS. 

Question: 214 
A company is running an order processing system on Amazon EC2 instances. The company wants to migrate microservices-based application. 
https://www.certshero.com 

Which combination of AWS services can the application use to meet these requirements? (Select TWO.) 
A. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) 
B. AWS Lambda 
C. AWS Migration Hub 
D. AWS AppSync 
E. AWS Application Migration Service 

Answer: A, B 
Explanation: 
The combination of AWS services that the application can use to migrate to a microservices-based application are Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and AWS Lambda. Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables customers to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. The application can use Amazon SQS to send, store, and receive messages between the microservices, ensuring that each message is processed only once and in the right order. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows customers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. The application can use AWS Lambda to create and deploy microservices as functions that are triggered by events, such as messages from Amazon SQS. AWS Migration Hub, AWS AppSync, and AWS Application Migration Service are not the best services to use for migrating to a microservices-based application. AWS Migration Hub is a service that provides a single location to track the progress of application migrations across multiple AWS and partner solutions. AWS AppSync is a service that simplifies the development of GraphQL APIs for real-time and offline data synchronization. AWS Application Migration Service is a service that enables customers to migrate their on-premises applications to AWS without making any changes to the applications, servers, or databases. 

Question: 215 
A company wants to access a report about the estimated environmental impact of the company's AWS usage. Which AWS service or feature should the company use to meet this requirement? 
A. AWS Organizations 
B. IAM policy 
C. AWS Billing console 
D. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The company should use the AWS Billing console to access a report about the estimated environmental impact of the company・s AWS usage. The AWS Billing console provides customers with various tools and reports to manage and monitor their AWS costs and usage. One of the reports available in the AWS Billing console is the AWS Sustainability Dashboard, which shows the estimated carbon footprint and energy mix of the customer・s AWS usage. The company can use this dashboard 
https://www.certshero.com 

to measure and improve the sustainability of their cloud workloads. AWS Organizations, IAM policy, and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) are not services or features that can provide a report about the estimated environmental impact of the company・s AWS usage. AWS Organizations is a service that enables customers to centrally manage and govern their AWS accounts. IAM policy is a document that defines the permissions for an IAM identity (user, group, or role) or an AWS resource. Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables customers to send messages to subscribers or other AWS services. 

Question: 216 
A company has an AWS-hosted website located behind an Application Load Balancer. The company wants to safeguard the website from SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Which AWS service should the company use? 
A. Amazon GuardDuty 
B. AWS WAF 
C. AWS Trusted Advisor 
D. Amazon Inspector 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The company should use AWS WAF to safeguard the website from SQL injection or cross-site scripting. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits that could affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. The company can use AWS WAF to create custom rules that block malicious requests that match certain patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. AWS WAF can be applied to web applications that are behind an Application Load Balancer, Amazon CloudFront, or Amazon API Gateway. Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Trusted Advisor, and Amazon Inspector are not the best services to use for this purpose. Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior across the AWS accounts and resources. AWS Trusted Advisor is a service that provides best practice recommendations for cost optimization, performance, security, and fault tolerance. Amazon

A company needs to host a web server on Amazon EC2 instances for at least 1 year. The web server cannot tolerate interruption. Which EC2 instance purchasing option will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 
A. On-Demand Instances 
B. Partial Upfront Reserved Instances 
C. Spot Instances 
D. No Upfront Reserved Instances 
Answer: B 
https://www.certshero.com 

Explanation: 
The most cost-effective EC2 instance purchasing option for the company that needs to host a web server on Amazon EC2 instances for at least 1 year and cannot tolerate interruption is Partial Upfront Reserved Instances. Reserved Instances are a pricing model that offer significant discounts compared to On-Demand Instances in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount of compute capacity for a fixed period of time (1 or 3 years). Partial Upfront Reserved Instances require customers to pay a portion of the total cost upfront, and the remaining cost in monthly installments over the term. This option offers a lower effective hourly rate than No Upfront Reserved Instances, which require no upfront payment but have higher monthly payments. On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances are not the best options for the company. On-Demand Instances are a pricing model that offer the most flexibility and no long-term commitment, but have the highest hourly rate. Spot 
Instances

Question: 218 
A company runs a database on Amazon Aurora in the us-east-1 Region. The company has a disaster recovery requirement that the database be available in another Region. Which solution meets this requirement with minimal disruption to the database operations? 
A. Perform an Aurora Multi-AZ deployment. 
B. Deploy Aurora cross-Region read replicas. 
C. Create Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume snapshots for Aurora and copy them to another Region. 
D. Deploy Aurora Replicas. 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The solution that meets the requirement of the company that runs a database on Amazon Aurora in the us-east-1 Region and has a disaster recovery requirement that the database be available in another Region with minimal disruption to the database operations is to deploy Aurora cross-Region read replicas. Aurora cross-Region read replicas are secondary Aurora clusters that are created in a different AWS Region from the primary Aurora cluster, and are kept in sync with the primary cluster using physical replication. The company can use Aurora cross-Region read replicas to improve the availability and durability of the database, as well as to reduce the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in case of a regional disaster. Performing an Aurora Multi-AZ deployment, creating Amazon EBS volume snapshots for Aurora and copying them to another Region, and deploying Aurora Replicas are not the best solutions for this requirement. An Aurora Multi-AZ deployment is a configuration that creates one or more Aurora Replicas within the same AWS Region as the primary Aurora cluster, and provides automatic failover in case of an Availability Zone outage. However, this does not provide cross-Region disaster recovery. Creating Amazon EBS volume snapshots for Aurora and copying them to another Region is a manual process that requires stopping the database, creating the snapshots, copying them to the target Region, and restoring them to a new Aurora cluster. This process can cause significant downtime and data loss. Deploying Aurora Replicas is a configuration that creates one or more secondary Aurora clusters within the same AWS Region as the primary Aurora cluster, and provides read scaling and high availability.

However, this does not provide cross-Region disaster recovery. 

Question: 219 
Which AWS service requires the customer to patch the guest operating system? 
A. AWS Lambda 
B. Amazon OpenSearch Service C. Amazon EC2 
D. Amazon ElastiCache 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The AWS service that requires the customer to patch the guest operating system is Amazon EC2. Amazon EC2 is a service that provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud, and allows customers to launch and run virtual servers, called instances, with a variety of operating systems, configurations, and specifications. The customer is responsible for patching and updating the guest operating system and any applications that run on the EC2 instances, as part of the security in the cloud. AWS Lambda, Amazon OpenSearch Service, and Amazon ElastiCache are not services that require the customer to patch the guest operating system. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows customers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Amazon OpenSearch Service is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale OpenSearch clusters in the AWS Cloud. Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed service that provides in-memory data store and cache solutions, such as Redis and Memcached. These services are managed by AWS, and AWS is responsible for patching and updating the underlying infrastructure and software. 

Question: 220 
Which benefit of the AWS Cloud helps companies achieve lower usage costs because of the aggregate usage of all AWS users? 
A. No need to guess capacity 
B. Ability to go global in minutes 
C. Economies of scale 
D. Increased speed and agility 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The benefit of the AWS Cloud that helps companies achieve lower usage costs because of the aggregate usage of all AWS users is economies of scale. Economies of scale means that AWS can achieve lower costs and higher efficiency by operating at a massive scale and passing the savings to the customers. AWS leverages the aggregate usage of all AWS users to negotiate better prices with hardware vendors, optimize power consumption, and improve operational processes. As a result, AWS can offer lower and more flexible pricing options to the customers, such as pay-as-you-go, 
https://www.certshero.com 

reserved, and spot pricing models. No need to guess capacity, ability to go global in minutes, and increased speed and agility are other benefits of the AWS Cloud, but they are not directly related to the aggregate usage of all AWS users. No need to guess capacity means that AWS customers can avoid the risk of over-provisioning or under-provisioning resources, and scale up or down as needed. Ability to go global in minutes means that AWS customers can deploy their applications and data in multiple regions around the world, and deliver them to users with high performance and availability.

Explanation: 
The perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) that connects technology and business is governance. The governance perspective focuses on the alignment of the IT strategy and processes with the business strategy and goals, as well as the management of the IT budget, risk, and compliance. The governance perspective capabilities are portfolio management, business performance management, and IT governance. The governance perspective helps organizations ensure that their cloud adoption delivers the expected business value and outcomes, and that their cloud solutions are secure, reliable, and compliant. Operations, people, and security are other perspectives of the AWS CAF, but they do not directly connect technology and business. The operations perspective focuses on the management and monitoring of the cloud resources and applications, as well as the automation and optimization of the operational processes. The people perspective focuses on the development and empowerment of the human resources, as well as the transformation of the organizational culture and structure. The security perspective focuses on the protection of the information assets and systems in the cloud, as well as the implementation of the security policies and controls. 
Question: 227 
A company needs to host a highly available application in the AWS Cloud. The application runs 
https://www.certshero.com 

infrequently for short periods of time. Which AWS service will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? 
A. Amazon EC2 
B. AWS Fargate 
C. AWS Lambda 
D. Amazon Aurora 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The AWS service that will meet the requirements of the company that needs to host a highly available application in the AWS Cloud that runs infrequently for short periods of time with the least amount of operational overhead is AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows customers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. The company can use AWS Lambda to create and deploy their application as functions that are triggered by events, such as API calls, messages, or schedules. AWS Lambda automatically scales the compute resources based on the demand, and customers only pay for the compute time they consume. AWS Lambda also simplifies the management and maintenance of the application, as customers do not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure, security, or availability. Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Aurora are not the best services to use for this purpose. Amazon EC2 is a service that provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud, and allows customers to launch and run virtual servers, called instances, with a variety of operating systems, configurations, and specifications. Amazon EC2 requires customers to provision and manage the instances, and pay for the instance hours they use, regardless of the application usage. AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows customers to run containerized applications without managing servers or clusters. AWS Fargate requires customers to specify the amount of CPU and memory resources for each container, and pay for the resources they allocate, regardless of the application usage. Amazon Aurora is a fully managed relational database service that provides high performance, availability, and compatibility. Amazon

A. AWS Budgets 
B. AWS Cost Explorer 
C. AWS Pricing Calculator 
D. AWS Cost and Usage Report 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The AWS tool that will meet the requirements of the company that is planning a migration to the 
https://www.certshero.com 

AWS Cloud and wants to examine the costs that are associated with different workloads is AWS Pricing Calculator. AWS Pricing Calculator is a tool that helps customers estimate the cost of using AWS services based on their requirements and preferences. The company can use AWS Pricing Calculator to compare the costs of different AWS services and configurations, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and more. AWS Pricing Calculator also provides detailed breakdowns of the cost components, such as compute, storage, network, and data transfer. AWS Pricing Calculator helps customers plan and optimize their cloud budget and migration strategy. AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer, and AWS Cost and Usage Report are not the best tools to use for this purpose. AWS Budgets is a tool that helps customers monitor and manage their AWS spending and usage against predefined budget limits and thresholds. AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that helps customers analyze and visualize their AWS spending and usage trends over time. AWS Cost and Usage Report is a tool that helps customers access comprehensive and granular information about their AWS costs and usage in a CSV or Parquet file. These

Question: 229 
A company is hosting a web application on Amazon EC2 instances. The company wants to implement custom conditions to filter and control inbound web traffic. Which AWS service will meet these requirements? 
A. Amazon GuardDuty 
B. AWSWAF 
C. Amazon Macie 
D. AWS Shield 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The AWS service that will meet the requirements of the company that is hosting a web application on Amazon EC2 instances and wants to implement custom conditions to filter and control inbound web traffic is AWS WAF. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits that could affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. The company can use AWS WAF to create custom rules that block malicious requests that match certain patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. AWS WAF can be applied to web applications that are behind an Application Load Balancer, Amazon CloudFront, or Amazon API Gateway. Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, and AWS Shield are not the best services to use for this purpose. Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior across the AWS accounts and resources. Amazon Macie is a data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in Amazon S3. AWS Shield is a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS. These services are more useful for detecting and preventing different types of threats and attacks, rather than filtering and controlling inbound web traffic based on custom conditions.

The company can use Amazon Lex to create a chatbot that can understand natural language and respond to user requests, using the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa. Amazon Lex also provides easy integration with other AWS services, such as Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Polly, and AWS Lambda, as well as popular platforms, such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Twilio. Amazon Lex helps customers create engaging and interactive chatbots for their web applications. Amazon Kendra, Amazon Textract, and Amazon Polly are not the best services to use for this purpose. Amazon Kendra is a service that helps customers provide accurate and natural answers to natural language queries using machine learning. Amazon Textract is a service that helps customers extract text and data from scanned documents using optical character recognition (OCR) and machine learning. Amazon Polly is a service that helps customers convert text into lifelike speech using deep learning. These services are more useful for different types of natural language processing and generation tasks, rather than creating and integrating chatbots. 

Question: 231 
Which AWS service is used to temporarily provide federated security credentials to a 
A. Amazon GuardDuty 
B. AWS Simple Token Service (AWS STS) 
C. AWS Secrets Manager 
D. AWS Certificate Manager 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The AWS service that is used to temporarily provide federated security credentials to a user is AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS). AWS STS is a service that enables customers to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that they authenticate (federated users). The company can use AWS STS to grant federated users access to AWS resources without creating permanent IAM users or sharing long-term credentials. AWS STS helps customers manage and secure access to their AWS resources for federated users. Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Secrets Manager, and AWS Certificate Manager are not the best services to use for this purpose. Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for malicious activity and 
https://www.certshero.com 

unauthorized behavior across the AWS accounts and resources. AWS Secrets Manager is a service that helps customers manage and rotate secrets, such as database credentials, API keys, and passwords. AWS Certificate Manager is a service that helps customers provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and internal connected resources. These services are more useful for different types of security and compliance tasks, rather than providing temporary federated security credentials to a user.

Question: 233 
A company has an application that runs periodically in an on-premises environment. The application runs for a few hours most days, but runs for 8 hours a day for a week at the end of each month. Which AWS service or feature should be used to host the application in the AWS Cloud? 
A. Amazon EC2 Standard Reserved Instances 
B. Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances 
C. AWS Wavelength 
D. Application Load Balancer 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Amazon 
EC2 
On-Demand 
Instances 
are 
instances 
that 
you 
pay 
for 
by 
the 
second, 
with 
no 
long-term 
commitments 
or 
upfront 
payments4. This option is suitable for applications that have unpredictable 
https://www.certshero.com 

or intermittent workloads, such as the one described in the question. Amazon EC2 Standard Reserved Instances are instances that you purchase for a one-year or three-year term, and pay a lower hourly rate compared to On-Demand Instances. This option is suitable for applications that have steady state or predictable usage. AWS Wavelength is a service that enables developers to build applications that deliver ultra-low latency to mobile devices and users by deploying AWS compute and storage at the edge of the 5G network. This option is not relevant for the application described in the question. Application Load Balancer is a type of load balancer that operates at the application layer and distributes traffic based on the content of the request. This option is not a service or feature to host the application, but rather to balance the traffic among multiple instances. 

Question: 234 
A company is reviewing the design of an application that will be migrated from on premises to a single Amazon EC2 instance. What should the company do to make the application highly available? 
A. Provision additional EC2 instances in other Availability Zones. 
B. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Assign the EC2 instance as the ALB's target. 
C. Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to create the EC2 instance. 
D. Provision the application by using an EC2 Spot Instance. 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Provisioning additional EC2 instances in other Availability Zones is a way to make the application highly available, as it reduces the impact of failures and increases fault tolerance. Configuring an Application Load Balancer and assigning the EC2 instance as the ALB・s target is a way to distribute traffic among multiple instances, but it does not make the application highly available if there is only one instance. Using an Amazon Machine Image to create the EC2 instance is a way to launch a virtual server with a preconfigured operating system and software, but it does not make the application highly available by itself. Provisioning the application by using an EC2 Spot Instance is a way to use spare EC2 capacity at up to 90% off the On-Demand price, but it does not make the application highly available, as Spot Instances can be interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute notification. 

Question: 235 
Which AWS service provides a highly accurate and easy-to-use enterprise search service that is powered by machine learning (ML)? 
A. Amazon Kendra 
B. Amazon SageMaker 
C. Amazon Augmented Al (Amazon A2I)

Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk, and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. None of these services provide an enterprise search service that is powered by machine learning. 

Question: 236 
A company provides a software as a service (SaaS) application. The company has a new customer that is based in a different country. The new customer's data needs to be hosted in that country. Which AWS service or infrastructure component should the company use to meet this requirement? 
A. AWS Shield 
B. Amazon S3 Object Lock 
C. AWS Regions 
D. Placement groups 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
AWS Regions are geographic areas around the world where AWS has clusters of data centers. Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZ・s within a geographic area. By hosting the customer・s data in a specific AWS Region, the company can meet the requirement of hosting the data in the customer・s country. AWS Shield is a service that provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. Amazon S3 Object Lock is a feature that allows you to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. You can use it to prevent an object from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. Placement groups are logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. Placement groups enable applications to participate in a low-latency, 10 Gbps network. None of these services or infrastructure components can help the company host the customer・s data in a different country.

A. Reserved Instances 
B. Spot Instances 
C. Dedicated Instances 
D. On-Demand Instances 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Spot Instances are instances that use spare EC2 capacity that is available for up to 90% off the On-Demand price. Because 
Spot 
Instances 
can 
be 
interrupted 
by 
EC2 
with 
two 
minutes

Question: 243 
A company is running workloads for multiple departments within a single VPC. The company needs to be able to bill each department for its resource usage. Which action should the company take to accomplish this goal with the LEAST operational overhead? 
A. Add a department tag to each resource and configure cost allocation tags. 
B. Move each department resource to its own VPC. 
C. Move each department resource to its own AWS account. 
D. Use AWS Organizations to get a billing report for each department. 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Adding a department tag to each resource and configuring cost allocation tags is an action that can help you accomplish the goal of billing each department for its resource usage with the least operational overhead. Tags are simple labels consisting of a key and an optional value that you can assign to AWS resources. You can use tags to organize your resources and track your AWS costs on a detailed level. Cost allocation tags enable you to track your AWS costs on a detailed level. After 
you 
activate 
cost 
allocation 
tags, 
AWS 
uses 
the 
cost 
allocation 
tags 
to 
organize 
your 
resource 
costs 
on 
your 
cost 
allocation 
report, 
to 
make 
it 
easier 
for 
you 
to 
categorize 
and 
track 
your 
AWS 
costs2. Moving each department resource to its own VPC or its own AWS account is an action that can help you isolate and control the resources for each department, but it would incur more operational overhead than using tags. Using AWS Organizations to get a billing report for each department is an action that can help you consolidate billing and payment across multiple AWS accounts, but it would not help you bill each department for its resource usage within a single VPC. 

Question: 244 
A large company has multiple departments. Each department has its own AWS account. Each department has purchased Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances. Some departments do not use all the Reserved Instances that they purchased, and other departments need more Reserved Instances than they purchased. The company needs to manage the AWS accounts for all the departments so that the departments can share the Reserved Instances. Which AWS service or tool should the company use to meet these requirements? 
A. AWS Systems Manager 
B. Cost Explorer 
C. AWS Trusted Advisor 
D. AWS Organizations 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
AWS Organizations is a service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. With AWS Organizations, you can apply service 
https://www.certshero.com 

control policies (SCPs) across multiple AWS accounts to restrict what services and actions users and roles can access. You 
can 
also 
use 
AWS 
Organizations 
to 
enable 
features 
such 
as 
consolidated 
billing, 
AWS 
Config 
rules 
and 
conformance 
packs, 
and 
AWS 
CloudFormation 
StackSets 
across 
multiple 
accounts3. One of the benefits of using AWS Organizations is that you can share your Reserved Instances (RIs) with all of the accounts in your organization. This 
enables 
you 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
billing 
benefits 
of 
RIs 
without 
having 
to 
specify 
which 
account 
will 
use 
them4. AWS Systems Manager is a service that gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS. Cost Explorer is a tool that enables you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Trusted Advisor is a service that provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. None of these services or tools can help you manage the AWS accounts for all the departments so that the departments can share the Reserved Instances.

instance 
and 
let 
Amazon 
RDS 
manage 
common 
database 
tasks 
such 
as 
backups, 
patching, 
scaling, 
and 
replication6. Amazon EC2 is a service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch a virtual server and install MySQL software on it. You 
have 
complete 
control 
over 
your 
database 
configuration, 
but 
you 
are 
responsible 
for 
managing 
and 
maintaining 
the 
database 
software 
and 
the 
underlying 
infrastructure7. Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ. None of these services can help you host and run a MySQL database. 

Question: 247 
A company wants its workload to perform consistently and correctly. Which benefit of AWS Cloud computing does this goal represent? 
A. Security 
B. Elasticity 
C. Pay-as-you-go pricing 
D. Reliability 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Reliability is the benefit of AWS Cloud computing that ensures the workload performs consistently and correctly. According 
to 
the 
AWS 
Cloud 
Practitioner 
Essentials 
course, 
reliability 
means 
"the 
ability 
of 
a

or 
service 
disruptions, 
dynamically 
acquire 
computing 
resources 
to 
meet 
demand, 
and 
mitigate 
disruptions 
such 
as 
misconfigurations 
or 
transient 
network 
issues."1 
Elasticity, security, and pay-as-you-go pricing are also benefits of AWS Cloud computing, but they do not directly relate to the goal of consistent and correct performance.

Which design principle is included in the operational excellence pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework? 
A. Create annotated documentation. 
B. Anticipate failure. 
C. Ensure performance efficiency. 
D. Optimize costs. 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Create annotated documentation is the design principle that is included in the operational excellence pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. According 
to 
the 
AWS 
Well-Architected 
Framework 
whitepaper, 
creating 
annotated 
documentation 
means 
"documenting 
your 
workload 
so 
that 
the 
team 
understands 
the 
architecture, 
how 
to 
operate 
the 
workload, 
and 
how 
the 
workload 
delivers 
value 
to 
customers."3 
Anticipate failure, ensure performance efficiency, and optimize costs are design principles that belong to other pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, such as reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. 

Question: 250 
A company is using Amazon RDS. A company is launching a critical business application in an AWS Region. How can the company increase resilience for this application? 
A. Deploy a copy of the application in another AWS account. 
B. Deploy the application by using multiple VPCs. 
C. Deploy the application by using multiple subnets. 
D. Deploy the application by using multiple Availability Zones. 
Answer: D 
https://www.certshero.com 

Explanation: 
Deploying the application by using multiple Availability Zones is the best way to increase resilience for the application. According to the Amazon RDS User Guide, "Amazon RDS provides high availability and failover support for DB instances using Multi-AZ deployments. In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The 
primary 
DB 
instance 
is 
synchronously 
replicated 
across 
Availability 
Zones 
to 
a 
standby 
replica 
to 
provide 
data 
redundancy, 
eliminate 
I/O 
freezes, 
and 
minimize 
latency 
spikes 
during 
system 
backups."4 
Deploying a copy of the application in another AWS account, using multiple VPCs, or using multiple subnets do not provide the same level of resilience as using multiple Availability Zones. 

Question: 251

A. VPC endpoint 
B. Virtual private gateway 
C. AWS Shield Standard 
D. AWS Config 
E. AWS WAF 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
AWS Shield Standard and AWS WAF are the AWS services or tools that are designed to protect a workload from SQL injections, cross-site scripting, and DDoS attacks. According to the AWS Shield Developer Guide, "AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS 
Shield 
provides 
always-on 
detection 
and 
automatic 
inline 
mitigations 
that 
minimize 
application 
downtime 
and 
latency, 
so 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
engage 
AWS 
Support 
to 
benefit 
from 
DDoS 
protection."5 
According to the AWS WAF Developer Guide, ：AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define.； VPC endpoint, virtual private gateway, and AWS Config are not designed to protect a workload from these types of attacks.

Question: 259 
Which actions are examples of a company's effort to right size its AWS resources to control cloud costs? (Select TWO.) 
A. Switch from Amazon RDS to Amazon DynamoDB to accommodate NoSQL datasets. 
B. Base the selection of Amazon EC2 instance types on past utilization patterns. 
C. Use Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies to move objects that users access infrequently to lower-cost storage tiers. 
D. Use Multi-AZ deployments for Amazon RDS. 
E. Replace existing Amazon EC2 instances with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 

Answer: B, C 
Explanation: 
Basing the selection of Amazon EC2 instance types on past utilization patterns is a way to right size the AWS resources and optimize the performance and cost. Using Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies to move objects that users access infrequently to lower-cost storage tiers is another way to reduce the storage costs and align them with the business value of the data. These 
two 
actions 
are 
recommended 
by 
the 
AWS 
Cost 
Optimization 
Pillar1. Switching from Amazon RDS to Amazon DynamoDB is not necessarily a cost-saving action, as it depends on the use case and the data model. Using Multi-AZ deployments for Amazon RDS is a way to improve the availability and durability of the database, but it also increases the cost. Replacing existing Amazon EC2 instances with AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a way to simplify the deployment and management of the application, but it does not affect the cost of the underlying EC2 instances. 

Question: 260 
A company has a single Amazon EC2 instance. The company wants to adopt a highly available architecture. What can the company do to meet this requirement? 
A. Scale vertically to a larger EC2 instance size. 
B. Scale horizontally across multiple Availability Zones. 
C. Purchase an EC2 Dedicated Instance. 
D. Change the EC2 instance family to a compute optimized instance. 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Scaling horizontally across multiple Availability Zones is a way to adopt a highly available architecture, as it increases the fault tolerance and resilience of the application. Scaling vertically to a larger EC2 instance size is a way to improve the performance of the application, but it does not improve the availability. Purchasing an EC2 Dedicated Instance is a way to isolate the instance from other AWS customers, but it does not improve the availability. Changing the EC2 instance family to a compute optimized instance is a way to optimize the instance type for the workload, but it does not

Question: 261 
A company is running an application that is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. The usage of the EC2 instances is higher during daytime hours than nighttime hours. The company wants to optimize the number of EC2 instances based on this usage pattern. Which AWS service or instance purchasing option should the company use to meet these requirements? 
A. Spot Instances 
B. Reserved Instances 
C. AWS CloudFormation 
D. AWS Auto Scaling 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
AWS Auto Scaling is the AWS service that allows users to optimize the number of EC2 instances based on the usage pattern, as it automatically adjusts the capacity to maintain steady and predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Spot Instances are a way to reduce the cost of EC2 instances by bidding on unused EC2 capacity, but they are not suitable for applications that require steady and reliable performance. Reserved Instances are a way to reduce the cost of EC2 instances by committing to a certain amount of usage for a period of time, but they are not flexible to adjust to the usage pattern. AWS CloudFormation is a way to automate the creation and management of AWS resources, but it does not optimize the number of EC2 instances based on the usage pattern. These

Question: 268 
A company wants to use Amazon EC2 instances for a stable production workload that will run for 1 year. Which instance purchasing option meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 
A. Dedicated Hosts 
B. Reserved Instances 
C. On-Demand Instances 
D. Spot Instances 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
B is correct because Reserved Instances are the instance purchasing option that offers the most cost-effective way to use Amazon EC2 instances for a stable production workload that will run for 1 year, as they provide significant discounts compared to On-Demand Instances in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount of computing power for a period of time. A is incorrect because Dedicated Hosts are the instance purchasing option that allows customers to use physical servers that are fully dedicated to their use, which is more expensive and less flexible than Reserved Instances. C is incorrect because On-Demand Instances are the instance purchasing option that allows customers to pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments, which is more suitable for short-term, variable, and unpredictable workloads.

A company needs a repository that stores source code. The company needs a way to update the running software when the code changes. Which combination of AWS services will meet these requirements? (Select TWO.) 
A. AWS CodeCommit 
B. AWS CodeDeploy 
C. Amazon DynamoDB D. Amazon S3 
E. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) 

Answer: A, B 
Explanation: 
A 
and 
B 
are 
correct 
because 
AWS 
CodeCommit 
is 
the 
AWS 
service 
that 
provides 
a 
fully 
managed 
source 
control 
service 
that 
hosts 
secure 
Git-based 
repositories1, 
and 
AWS 
CodeDeploy 
is 
the 
AWS 
service 
that 
automates 
code 
deployments 
to 
any 
instance, 
including 
Amazon 
EC2 
instances 
and 
servers 
running 
on-premises2. These two services can be used together to store source code and update the running software when the code changes. C 
is 
incorrect 
because 
Amazon 
DynamoDB 
is 
the 
AWS 
service 
that 
provides 
a 
fully 
managed 
NoSQL 
database 
service 
that 
supports 
key-value 
and 
document 
data 
models3. It is not related to storing source code or updating software. D 
is 
incorrect 
because 
Amazon 
S3 
is 
the 
AWS 
service 
that 
provides 
object 
storage 
through 
a 
web 
service 
interface4. It can be used to store source code, but it does not provide source control features or update software. E is incorrect because Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is the AWS service that allows users to run, scale, and secure Docker container applications. It can be used to deploy containerized software, but it does not store source code or update software. 

Question: 270 
A company is setting up AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) on an AWS account. Which recommendation complies with IAM security best practices? 
A. Use the account root user access keys for administrative tasks. 
B. Grant broad permissions so that all company employees can access the resources they need. 
C. Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security during the login process. 
D. Avoid rotating credentials to prevent issues in production applications. 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
C is correct because turning on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security during the login process is one of the IAM security best practices recommended by AWS. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of the user name and password, making it harder for attackers to access the AWS account. A is incorrect because using the account root user access keys for administrative tasks is not 
https://www.certshero.com 

a good practice, as the root user has full access to all the resources in the AWS account and can cause irreparable damage if compromised. AWS recommends creating individual IAM users with the least privilege principle and using roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances. B is incorrect because granting broad permissions so that all company employees can access the resources they need is not a good practice, as it increases the risk of unauthorized or accidental actions on the AWS resources. AWS recommends granting only the permissions that are required to perform a task and using groups to assign permissions to IAM users. D is incorrect because avoiding rotating credentials to prevent issues in production applications is not a good practice, as it increases the risk of credential leakage or compromise. AWS recommends rotating credentials regularly and using temporary security credentials from AWS STS when possible. 

Question: 271 
A company wants to run its production workloads on AWS. The company needs concierge service, a designated AWS technical account manager (TAM), and technical support that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Which AWS Support plan will meet these requirements? 
A. AWS Basic Support 
B. AWS Enterprise Support 
C. AWS Business Support 
D. AWS Developer Support 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
B is correct because AWS Enterprise Support is the AWS Support plan that provides concierge service, a designated AWS technical account manager (TAM), and technical support that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This plan is designed for customers who run mission-critical workloads on AWS and need the highest level of support. A is incorrect because AWS Basic Support is the AWS Support plan that provides customer service and support for billing and account issues, service limit increases, and technical support for a limited set of AWS services. It does not provide concierge service, a designated TAM, or 24/7 technical support. C is incorrect because AWS Business Support is the AWS Support plan that provides customer service and support for billing and account issues, service limit increases, and technical support for all AWS services, as well as access to AWS Trusted Advisor and AWS Support API. It does not provide concierge service or a designated TAM. D is incorrect because AWS Developer Support is the AWS Support plan that provides customer service and support for billing and account issues, service limit increases, and technical support for all AWS services, as well as access to AWS Trusted Advisor. It does not provide concierge service, a designated TAM, or 24/7 technical support.

A. Internet gateways 
https://www.certshero.com 

B. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
C. Network ACLs 
D. Security groups 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
D is correct because security groups are the AWS service or feature that can be used to control inbound and outbound traffic on an Amazon EC2 instance. Security groups act as a virtual firewall for the EC2 instance, allowing users to specify which protocols, ports, and source or destination IP addresses are allowed or denied. A is incorrect because internet gateways are the AWS service or feature that enable communication between instances in a VPC and the internet. They do not control the traffic on an EC2 instance. B is incorrect because AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the AWS service or feature that enables users to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. It does not control the traffic on an EC2 instance. C is incorrect because network ACLs are the AWS service or feature that provide an optional layer of security for the VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. They do not control the traffic on an EC2 instance.

A. On-premises to cloud native 
B. Hybrid to cloud native 
C. On-premises to hybrid 
D. Cloud native to hybrid 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
C is correct because moving a workload from a local data center to an architecture that is distributed between the local data center and the AWS Cloud is an example of an on-premises to hybrid migration. A hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment that uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud, and public cloud services with orchestration between the platforms. A is incorrect because on-premises to cloud native migration is the process of moving a workload from a local data center to an architecture that is fully hosted and managed on the AWS Cloud. B is incorrect because hybrid to cloud native migration is the process of moving a workload from an architecture that is distributed between the local data center and the AWS Cloud to an architecture that is fully hosted and managed on the AWS Cloud.

Question: 315 
In the AWS shared responsibility model, which tasks are the responsibility of AWS? (Select TWO.) 
A. Patch an Amazon EC2 instance operating system. 
B. Configure a security group. 
C. Monitor the health of an Availability Zone. 
D. Protect the infrastructure that runs Amazon EC2 instances. 
E. Manage access to the data in an Amazon S3 bucket 

Answer: C, D 
Explanation: 
According to the AWS shared responsibility model, AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, which includes the tasks of monitoring the health of an Availability Zone and protecting the infrastructure that runs Amazon EC2 instances. An Availability Zone is a physically isolated location within an AWS Region that has its own power, cooling, and network connectivity. AWS monitors the health and performance of each Availability Zone and notifies customers of any issues or disruptions. AWS also protects the infrastructure that runs AWS services, such as Amazon EC2, by implementing physical, environmental, and operational security measures. AWS is not responsible for patching an Amazon EC2 instance operating system, configuring a security group, or managing access to the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. These are the customer・s responsibilities for security in the cloud. The 
https://www.certshero.com 

customer must ensure that the operating system and applications on their EC2 instances are up to date and secure. The customer must also configure the security group rules that control the inbound and outbound traffic for their EC2 instances. The 
customer

Question: 316 
A company・s IT team is managing MySQL database server clusters. The IT team has to patch the database and take backup snapshots of the data in the clusters. The company wants to move this workload to AWS so that these tasks will be completed automatically. What should the company do to meet these requirements? 
A. Deploy MySQL database server clusters on Amazon EC2 instances. 
B. Use Amazon RDS with a MySQL database. 
C. Use an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy MySQL database servers on Amazon EC2 instances. 
D. Migrate all the MySQL database data to Amazon S3. 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Amazon RDS is a service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Amazon RDS supports MySQL as one of the database engines. By using Amazon RDS with a MySQL database, the company can offload the tasks of patching the database and taking backup snapshots to AWS. Amazon RDS automatically patches the database software and operating system of the database instances. Amazon RDS also automatically backs up the database and retains the backups for a user-defined retention period. The company can also restore the database to any point in time within the retention period. Deploying MySQL database server clusters on Amazon EC2 instances, using an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy MySQL database servers on Amazon EC2 instances, or migrating all the MySQL database data to Amazon S3 are not the best options to meet the requirements. These 
options 
would 
not 
automate 
the 
tasks 
of 
patching 
the 
database 
and 
taking 
backup 
snapshots, 
and 
would 
require 
more 
operational 
overhead 
from

Question: 318 
A company wants to use the latest technologies and wants to minimize its capital investment. Instead of upgrading on-premises infrastructure, the company wants to move to the AWS Cloud. Which AWS Cloud benefit does this scenario describe? 
A. Increased speed to market 
B. The trade of infrastructure expenses for operating expenses 
C. Massive economies of scale 
D. The ability to go global in minutes 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The trade of infrastructure expenses for operating expenses is one of the benefits of the AWS Cloud. By moving to the AWS Cloud, the company can avoid the upfront costs of purchasing and maintaining on-premises infrastructure, such as servers, storage, network, and software. Instead, the company can pay only for the AWS resources and services that they use, as they use them. This reduces the risk and complexity of planning and managing IT infrastructure, and allows the company to focus on innovation and growth. Increased speed to market, massive economies of scale, and the ability to go global in minutes are also benefits of the AWS Cloud, but they are not the best ones to describe this scenario. Increased speed to market means that the company can launch new products and services faster by using AWS services and tools. Massive economies of scale means that the company can benefit from the lower costs and higher performance that AWS achieves by operating at a large scale. The 
ability 
to 
go 
global 
in 
minutes 
means 
that 
the 
company 
can 
deploy 
their 
applications 
and 
data 
in 
multiple 
regions 
and 
availability 
zones 
around 
the

Question: 327 
A company is running an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. An ecommerce company is using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups to manage a fleet of web servers running on Amazon EC2. This architecture follows which AWS Well-Architected Framework best practice? 
A. Secure the workload 
B. Decouple infrastructure components 
C. Design for failure 
D. Think parallel 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Design for failure is one of the best practices of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. It means that the architecture should be resilient and fault-tolerant, and able to handle failures without impacting the availability and performance of the applications. By using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, the ecommerce company can design for failure by automatically scaling the number of EC2 instances up or down based on demand or health status. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups can also distribute the EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones, which are isolated locations within an AWS Region that have independent power, cooling, and network connectivity. This 
way, 
the 
company 
can 
ensure 
that 
their 
web 
servers 
can 
handle 
traffic 
spikes, 
recover 
from 
failures, 
and 
provide 
a 
consistent 
user 
experience 


Question: 328 
Which tasks are the responsibility of the customer, according to the AWS shared responsibility model? (Select TWO.) 
A. Patch the Amazon RDS operating system. 
B. Upgrade the firmware of the network infrastructure. 
C. Manage data encryption. 
D. Maintain physical access control in an AWS Region. 
E. Grant least privilege access to IAM users. 

Answer: C, E 
Explanation: 
According to the AWS shared responsibility model, the customer is responsible for security in the cloud, which includes the tasks of managing data encryption and granting least privilege access to IAM users. Data encryption is the process of transforming data into an unreadable format that can only be accessed with a key or a password. The customer must decide whether to encrypt their data at rest (when it is stored on AWS) or in transit (when it is moving between AWS and the customer or 
https://www.certshero.com 

between AWS services). The customer must also choose the encryption method, algorithm, and key management solution that best suit their needs. AWS 
provides 
various 
services 
and 
features 
that 
support 
data 
encryption, 
such 
as 
AWS 
Key 
Management 
Service 
(AWS 
KMS), 
AWS 
Certificate 
Manager 
(ACM), 
and 
AWS 
Encryption 
SDK5 
IAM users are entities that represent the people or applications that interact with AWS resources and services. The customer must grant the IAM users the minimum permissions that they need to perform their tasks, and avoid giving them unnecessary or excessive access. This is known as the principle of least privilege, and it helps reduce the risk of unauthorized or malicious actions. The customer can use IAM policies, roles, groups, and permissions boundaries to manage the access of IAM users.

Question: 330 
A company is migrating to the AWS Cloud to meet storage needs. The company wants to optimize costs based on the amount of storage that the company uses. Which AWS offering or benefit will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 
A. Pay-as-you-go pricing 
B. Savings Plans 
C. AWS Free Tier 
D. Volume-based discounts 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Volume-based discounts are an AWS offering or benefit that can help the company optimize costs based on the amount of storage that the company uses. Volume-based discounts are discounts that AWS provides for some storage services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon EBS, when the company 
https://www.certshero.com 

stores a large amount of data. The more data the company stores, the lower the price per GB. For example, Amazon S3 offers six storage classes, each with a different price per GB. The 
price 
per 
GB 
decreases 
as 
the 
amount 
of 
data 
stored 
in 
each 
storage 
class 
increases 


Question: 331 
A company wants to minimize network latency between its Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances do not need to be highly available. Which solution meets these requirements? 
A. Use EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone. 
B. Use Amazon CloudFront as the database for the EC2 instances. 
C. Use EC2 instances in the same edge location and the same Availability Zone. 
D. Use EC2 instances in the same edge location and the same AWS Region. 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Using EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone is a solution that meets the requirements of minimizing network latency between the EC2 instances and not needing high availability. An Availability Zone is a physically isolated location within an AWS Region that has its own power, cooling, and network connectivity. EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone can communicate with each other using low-latency private IP addresses. However, 
EC2 
instances 
in 
a 
single 
Availability 
Zone 
are 
not 
highly 
available, 
because 
they 
are 
vulnerable

Question: 332 
A company seeks cost savings in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount of an AWS service or category ofAWS services for 1 year or 3 years. Which AWS pricing model or offering will meet these requirements? 
A. Pay-as-you-go pricing 
B. Savings Plans 
C. AWS Free Tier 
D. Volume discounts 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Savings Plans are an AWS pricing model or offering that can meet the requirements of seeking cost savings in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount of an AWS service or category of AWS services for 1 year or 3 years. Savings Plans are flexible plans that offer significant discounts on AWS compute usage, such as EC2, Lambda, and Fargate. The company can choose from two types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans and EC2 Instance Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans provide the most flexibility and apply to any eligible compute usage, regardless of instance family, size, region, operating system, or tenancy. EC2 Instance Savings Plans provide more savings and 
https://www.certshero.com 

apply to a specific instance family within a region. The company can select the amount of compute usage per hour (e.g., $10/hour) that they want to commit to for the duration of the plan (1 year or 3 years). The 
company 
will 
pay 
the 
discounted 
Savings 
Plan 
rate 
for 
the 
amount 
of 
usage 
that 
matches 
their 
commitment, 
and 
the

rate 
for 
any 
usage 
beyond 
that 


Question: 333 
Which company needs to apply security rules to a subnet for Amazon EC2 instances. Which AWS service or feature provides this functionality? 
A. Network ACLs 
B. Security groups 
C. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) 
D. AWS Config 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Network ACLs (network access control lists) are an AWS service or feature that provides the functionality of applying security rules to a subnet for EC2 instances. A subnet is a logical partition of an IP network within a VPC (virtual private cloud). A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where the company can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that they define. A network ACL is a virtual firewall that controls the inbound and outbound traffic for one or more subnets. The company can use network ACLs to allow or deny traffic based on protocol, port, or source and destination IP address. Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that they do not track the traffic that flows through them. Therefore, 
the 
company 
must 
create 
rules 
for 
both 
inbound 
and 
outbound 
traffic4 


Question: 334 
A company wants to migrate its high-performance computing (HPC) application to Amazon EC2 instances. The application has multiple components. The application must have fault tolerance and must have the ability to fail over automatically. Which AWS infrastructure solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST latency between components? 
A. Multiple AWS Regions 
B. Multiple edge locations 
C. Multiple Availability Zones 
D. Regional edge caches 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Using EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones is an AWS infrastructure solution that meets the requirements of migrating a high performance computing (HPC) application to AWS with fault tolerance and failover capabilities, and with the least latency between components. An Availability 
https://www.certshero.com 

Zone is a physically isolated location within an AWS Region that has its own power, cooling, and network connectivity. EC2 instances within the same Region can communicate with each other using low-latency private IP addresses. By using EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones, the company can achieve fault tolerance and failover for their HPC application, because they can distribute the workload and data across different locations that are independent of each other. If 
one 
Availability 
Zone 
becomes 
unavailable 
or 
impaired, 
the 
company 
can 
redirect 
the 
traffic 
and 
data 
to 
another 
Availability 
Zone 
without 
affecting 
the 
performance 
and 
availability 
of 
the 
application5

Realigning teams to focus on products and value streams, and using agile methods to rapidly iterate and evolve are tasks that the company should perform to meet the requirements of becoming more responsive to customer inquiries and feedback, according to the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF). AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called perspectives: business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations. Each perspective is divided into capabilities, which describe the skills and processes to execute the transition effectively. The people perspective helps you prepare your organization for cloud adoption, and includes capabilities such as organizational change management, staff skills and readiness, and organizational alignment. The business perspective helps you align IT strategy with business strategy, and includes capabilities such as business case development, value proposition, and product ownership. Creating new value propositions with new products and services is a task that belongs to the business perspective, but it is not directly related to the requirement of becoming more responsive to customer inquiries and feedback. Using a new data and analytics platform to create actionable insights is a task that belongs to the platform perspective, which helps you design, implement, and optimize the architecture of the AWS environment. However, it is also not directly related to the requirement of becoming more responsive to customer inquiries and feedback. Migrating and modernizing legacy infrastructure is a task that belongs to the operations perspective, which helps you enable, run, use, operate, and recover IT workloads to the level agreed upon with your business stakeholders. However, it is also not directly related to the requirement of becoming more responsive to customer inquiries and feedback. 

Question: 351 
A company is building an application on AWS. The application needs to comply with credit card regulatory requirements. The company needs proof that the AWS services and deployment are in compliance. Which actions should the company take to meet these requirements? (Select TWO.) 
A. Use Amazon Inspector to submit the application for certification. 
B. Ensure that the application's underlying hardware components comply with requirements. 
https://www.certshero.com 

C. Use AWS Artifact to access AWS documents about the compliance of the services. 
D. Get the compliance of the application certified by a company assessor. 
E. Use AWS Security Hub to certify the compliance of the application. 

Answer: C, D 
Explanation: 
Using AWS Artifact to access AWS documents about the compliance of the services, and getting the compliance of the application certified by a company assessor are actions that the company should take to meet the requirements of complying with credit card regulatory requirements. AWS Artifact is a service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements. Reports available in AWS Artifact include our Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls. AWS Artifact can help you demonstrate compliance with credit card regulatory requirements by providing you with proof that the AWS services and deployment are in compliance. Getting the compliance of the application certified by a company assessor is an action that the company should take to ensure that the application meets the specific requirements of the credit card industry. A company assessor is an independent third-party entity that is qualified to assess the compliance of the application with the relevant standards and regulations. Using Amazon Inspector to submit the application for certification is not an action that the company should take, because Amazon Inspector is a service that helps you improve the security and compliance of your applications deployed on AWS by automatically assessing them for vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices, but it does not provide certification for the applications. Ensuring that the application・s underlying hardware components comply with requirements is not an action that the company should take, because the application is deployed on AWS, and AWS is responsible for the security and compliance of the underlying hardware components. This is part of the shared responsibility model, where AWS is responsible for security of the cloud, and customers are responsible for security in the cloud. Using AWS Security Hub to certify the compliance of the application is not an action that the company should take, because AWS Security Hub is a service that gives you a comprehensive view of your security posture across your AWS accounts and helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices, but it does not provide certification for the applications. 

Question: 352 
A company has set up a VPC on AWS. The company needs a dedicated connection between the VPC and the company・s on-premises network. Which action should the company take to meet this requirement? 
A. Establish a VPN connection between the VPC and the company's on-premises network. 
B. Establish an AWS Direct Connect connection between the VPC and the company's on-premises network. 
C. Attach an internet gateway to the VPC. Use the AWS public endpoints for connectivity. 
D. Configure Amazon Connect to provide connectivity between the VPC and the company's on-premises network. 
https://www.certshero.com 


Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Establishing an AWS Direct Connect connection between the VPC and the company・s on-premises network is the action that the company should take to meet the requirement of having a dedicated connection between the VPC and the company・s on-premises network. AWS Direct Connect is a service that lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can create a private connection between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections. Establishing a VPN connection between the VPC and the company・s on-premises network is an action that the company can take to create a secure and encrypted connection between the VPC and the company・s on-premises network, but it is not a dedicated connection, as it uses the public internet as the transport mechanism. Attaching an internet gateway to the VPC and using the AWS public endpoints for connectivity is an action that the company can take to enable communication between the VPC and the internet, but it is not a dedicated connection, as it also uses the public internet as the transport mechanism. Configuring Amazon Connect to provide connectivity between the VPC and the company・s on-premises network is not an action that the company can take, because Amazon Connect is a service that lets you set up and manage a contact center in the cloud, but it does not provide network connectivity between the VPC and the company・s on-premises network.

A. Cost Explorer 
B. AWS Trusted Advisor 
C. Service Quotas 
D. AWS Budgets 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
AWS Budgets is a service that helps you plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations, and track how close your plan is to your budgeted amount. You can set custom budgets that alert you when you exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted thresholds. You can also use AWS Budgets to set a maximum spending limit on AWS services each month and set up alerts for when you reach your spending limit. Cost Explorer is a service that enables you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. You can use Cost Explorer to view charts and graphs that show how your costs are trending, identify areas that need further inquiry, and see the impact of your cost management actions.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that enables you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk supports several platform configurations for Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker web applications that can run on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. You can also use Elastic Beanstalk to launch a virtual machine (VM) and MySQL database on AWS with the least operational effort. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that enables you to easily run, scale, and secure Docker containerized applications on AWS. However, it requires more operational effort than Elastic Beanstalk, as you need to define your application architecture and the specifications of the containers that run it. Amazon Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers everything you need to build an application or website, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan. It is designed for developers who have little or no prior cloud experience and want to launch and manage applications on AWS with minimal complexity.

Question: 427 
A company wants its Amazon EC2 instances to share the same geographic area but use multiple independent underlying power sources. Which solution achieves this goal? 
A. Use EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone. 
B. Use EC2 instances in multiple AWS Regions. 
C. Use EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones in the same AWS Region. 
D. Use EC2 instances in the same edge location and the same AWS Region. 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The solution that achieves the goal of having Amazon EC2 instances share the same geographic area but use multiple independent underlying power sources is to use EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones in the same AWS Region. An Availability Zone is a physically isolated location within an AWS Region that has its own power, cooling, and network connectivity. An AWS Region is a geographical area that consists of two or more Availability Zones. By 
using 
multiple 
Availability 
Zones, 
users 
can 
increase 
the 
fault 
tolerance 
and 
resilience 
of 
their 
applications, 
as 
well 
as 
reduce 
latency 
for 
end 
users3. Using EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone, multiple AWS Regions, or the same edge location and the same AWS Region would not meet the requirement of having multiple independent power sources.

of 
the 
data 
across 
three 
Availability 
Zones 
and 
continuously 
backing 
up 
the 
data 
to 
Amazon

Question: 430 
Which AWS Cloud benefit describes the ability to acquire resources as they are needed and release resources when they are no longer needed? 
A. Economies of scale 
B. Elasticity 
C. Agility 
D. Security 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The AWS Cloud benefit that describes the ability to acquire resources as they are needed and release resources when they are no longer needed is elasticity. Elasticity means that users can quickly add and remove resources to match the demand of their applications, and only pay for what they use. Elasticity 
enables 
users 
to 
handle 
unpredictable 
workloads, 
reduce 
costs, 
and 
improve 
performance1. Economies of scale, agility, and security are other benefits of the AWS Cloud, but they do not describe the specific ability of acquiring and releasing resources on demand.

Question: 431 
A company wants to design a reliable web application that is hosted on Amazon EC2. Which approach will achieve this goal? 
A. Launch large EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone. 
B. Spread EC2 instances across more than one security group. 
C. Spread EC2 instances across more than one Availability Zone. 
D. Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from AWS Marketplace. 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The approach that will achieve the goal of designing a reliable web application that is hosted on Amazon EC2 is to spread EC2 instances across more than one Availability Zone. An Availability Zone is a physically isolated location within an AWS Region that has its own power, cooling, and network connectivity. By 
spreading 
EC2 
instances 
across 
multiple 
Availability 
Zones, 
users 
can 
increase 
the 
fault 
tolerance 
and 
availability 
of 
their 
web 
applications, 
as 
well 
as 
reduce 
latency 
for 
end 
users2. Launching large EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone, spreading EC2 instances across more than one security group, or using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from AWS Marketplace are not sufficient to ensure reliability, as they do not provide redundancy or resilience in case of an outage in one Availability Zone. 

Question: 432 
A company has a MySQL database running on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The company now requires higher availability in the event of an outage. Which set of tasks would meet this requirement? 
A. Add an Application Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instance. 
B. Configure EC2 Auto Recovery to move the instance to another Availability Zone. 
C. Migrate to Amazon RDS and enable Multi-AZ. 
D. Enable termination protection for the EC2 instance to avoid outages. 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The set of tasks that would meet the requirement of having higher availability for a MySQL database running on a single Amazon EC2 instance is to migrate to Amazon RDS and enable Multi-AZ. Amazon RDS is a fully managed relational database service that supports MySQL and other popular database engines. By enabling Multi-AZ, users can have a primary database in one Availability Zone and a synchronous standby replica in another Availability Zone. In 
case 
of 
a 
planned 
or 
unplanned 
outage 
of 
the 
primary 
database, 
Amazon 
RDS 
automatically 
fails 
over 
to 
the 
standby 
replica 
with 
minimal 
disruption3. Adding an Application Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instance, configuring EC2 Auto Recovery to move the instance to another Availability Zone, or enabling termination protection for the EC2 instance would not provide higher availability for the database, as they do not address the single point of failure or data replication issues.

C. AWS Artifact 
D. Amazon CloudFront reports 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The AWS service or resource that will meet the requirement of verifying if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all users within its AWS accounts is IAM credential reports. IAM credential reports are downloadable reports that list all the users in an AWS account and the status of their various credentials, including passwords, access keys, and MFA devices. Users 
can 
use 
IAM 
credential 
reports 
to

customers. It 
offers 
different 
plans 
with 
varying 
levels 
of 
access 
to 
AWS 
experts, 
response 
times, 
and 
features3. AWS Support does not provide a comprehensive framework for operational support. AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) is a guidance tool that helps customers plan and execute their cloud migration journey. It 
provides 
a 
set 
of 
perspectives, 
capabilities, 
and 
best 
practices 
to 
align 
the 
business 
and 
technical 
aspects 
of 
cloud 
adoption4. AWS CAF does not focus on operational support for existing workloads on AWS. AWS Managed Services (AMS) is a service that operates AWS infrastructure on behalf of customers. It 
provides 
a 
secure 
and 
compliant 
environment, 
automates 
common 
activities, 
and 
applies 
best 
practices 
for 
provisioning, 
patching, 
backup, 
recovery, 
and 
monitoring5. AMS does not provide a framework for customers to operate their own workloads on AWS. 

Question: 435 
A company is building an application in the AWS Cloud. The company wants to use temporary credentials for the application to access other AWS resources. 
Which AWS service will meet these requirements? 
A. AWS Key Management Service (Aws KMS) 
B. AWS CloudHSM 
C. Amazon Cognito 
D. AWS Security Token Service (Aws STS) 

Answer: D 
Explanation: AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a service that provides temporary security credentials to users or applications that need to access AWS resources. The temporary credentials have a limited lifetime and can be configured to last from a few minutes to several hours. The credentials are not stored with the user or application, but are generated dynamically and provided on request. The 
credentials 
work 
almost 
identically 
to 
long-term 
access 
key 
credentials, 
but 
have 
the 
advantage 
of 
not 
requiring 
distribution, 
rotation, 
or 
revocation1. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a service that provides encryption and decryption services for data and keys. It 
does 
not 
provide 
temporary 
security 
credentials2. AWS CloudHSM is a service that provides hardware security modules (HSMs) for cryptographic operations and key management. It 
does 
not 
provide 
temporary 
security 
credentials3. Amazon Cognito is a service that provides user authentication and authorization for web and mobile applications. It 
can 
also 
provide 
temporary 
security 
credentials 
for 
authenticated 
users, 
but 
not 
for 
applications4. 
Question: 436 
Which AWS service offers object storage? 
https://www.certshero.com 

A. Amazon RDS 
B. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) 
C. Amazon S3 
D. Amazon DynamoDB 

Answer: C 
Explanation: Amazon S3 is the AWS service that offers object storage. Object storage is a technology that stores and manages data in an unstructured format called objects. Each object consists of the data, metadata, and a unique identifier. Object 
storage 
is 
ideal 
for 
storing 
large 
amounts 
of 
unstructured 
data, 
such 
as 
photos, 
videos, 
email, 
web 
pages, 
sensor 
data, 
and 
audio 
files1. Amazon 
S3 
provides 
industry-leading 
scalability, 
data 
availability, 
security, 
and 
performance 
for 
object 
storage2. Amazon RDS is the AWS service that offers relational database storage. Relational database storage is a technology that stores and manages data in a structured format called tables. Each table consists of rows and columns that define the attributes and values of the dat 
a. Relational 
database 
storage 
is 
ideal 
for 
storing 
structured 
or 
semi-structured 
data, 
such 
as 
customer 
records, 
inventory, 
transactions, 
and 
analytics3. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is the AWS service that offers file storage. File storage is a technology that stores and manages data in a hierarchical format called files and folders. Each file consists of the data and metadata, and each folder consists of files or subfolders. File 
storage 
is 
ideal 
for 
storing 
shared 
data 
that 
can 
be 
accessed 
by 
multiple 
users 
or 
applications, 
such 
as 
home 
directories, 
content 
repositories, 
media 
libraries, 
and 
configuration 
files4. Amazon DynamoDB is the AWS service that offers NoSQL database storage. NoSQL database storage is a technology that stores and manages data in a flexible format called documents or key-value pairs. Each document or key-value pair consists of the data and metadata, and can have different attributes and values depending on the schema. NoSQL database storage is ideal for storing dynamic or unstructured data that requires high performance, scalability, and availability, such as web applications, social media, gaming, and IoT. 

Question: 437 
A company needs to deploy applications in the AWS Cloud as quickly as possible. The company also needs to minimize the complexity that is related to the management of AWS resources. 
Which AWS service should the company use to meet these requirements? 
A. AWS config 
B. AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
C. Amazon EC2 
D. Amazon Personalize 
https://www.certshero.com 


Answer: B 
Explanation: 
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is the AWS service that allows customers to deploy applications in the AWS Cloud as quickly as possible. AWS Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Customers 
can 
upload 
their 
code 
and 
Elastic 
Beanstalk 
will 
take 
care 
of 
the 
rest1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk also minimizes the complexity that is related to the management of AWS resources. Customers 
can 
retain 
full 
control 
of 
the 
underlying 
AWS 
resources 
powering 
their 
applications 
and 
adjust 
the 
settings 
to 
suit 
their 
needs1. Customers 
can 
also 
use 
the 
AWS 
Management 
Console, 
the 
AWS 
Command 
Line 
Interface 
(AWS 
CLI), 
or 
APIs 
to 
manage 
their 
applications1. AWS Config is the AWS service that enables customers to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of their AWS resources. AWS 
Config 
continuously 
monitors 
and 
records 
the 
configuration 
changes 
of 
the 
resources 
and 
evaluates 
them 
against 
desired 
configurations 
or 
best 
practices2. AWS Config does not help customers deploy applications in the AWS Cloud as quickly as possible or minimize the complexity that is related to the management of AWS resources. Amazon EC2 is the AWS service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Customers 
can 
launch 
virtual 
servers 
called 
instances 
and 
choose 
from 
various 
configurations 
of 
CPU, 
memory, 
storage, 
and 
networking 
resources3. Amazon EC2 does not automatically handle the deployment or management of AWS resources for customers. Customers have to manually provision, configure, monitor, and scale their instances and other related resources. Amazon Personalize is the AWS service that enables customers to create personalized recommendations for their users based on their behavior and preferences. Amazon 
Personalize 
uses 
machine 
learning 
to 
analyze 
data 
and 
deliver 
real-time 
recommendations4. Amazon Personalize does not help customers deploy applications in the AWS Cloud as quickly as possible or minimize the complexity that is related to the management of AWS resources. 

Question: 438 
Which AWS service or feature can a company use to apply security rules to specific Amazon EC2 instances? 
A. Network ACLs 
B. Security groups 
C. AWS Trusted Advisor 
D. AWS WAF 

Answer: B 
Explanation: Security groups are the AWS service or feature that can be used to apply security rules to specific Amazon EC2 instances. Security groups are virtual firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic for one or more instances. Customers can create security groups and add rules that reflect the 
https://www.certshero.com 

role of the instance that is associated with the security group. For 
example, 
a 
web 
server 
instance 
needs 
security 
group 
rules 
that 
allow 
inbound 
HTTP 
and 
HTTPS 
access, 
while 
a 
database 
instance 
needs 
rules 
that 
allow 
access 
for 
the 
type 
of 
database12. Security 
groups 
are 
stateful, 
meaning 
that 
the 
responses 
to 
allowed 
inbound 
traffic 
are 
also 
allowed, 
regardless 
of 
the 
outbound 
rules1. Customers 
can 
assign 
multiple 
security 
groups 
to 
an 
instance, 
and 
the 
rules 
from 
each 
security 
group 
are 
effectively 
aggregated 
to 
create 
one 
set 
of 
rules1. Network ACLs are another AWS service or feature that can be used to control the traffic for a subnet. Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that they do not track the traffic that they allow. Therefore, 
customers 
must 
add 
rules 
for 
both 
inbound 
and 
outbound 
traffic3. Network ACLs are applied at the subnet level, not at the instance level. AWS Trusted Advisor is an AWS service that provides best practice recommendations for security, performance, cost optimization, and fault tolerance. AWS 
Trusted 
Advisor 
does 
not 
apply 
security 
rules 
to 
specific 
Amazon 
EC2 
instances, 
but 
it 
can 
help 
customers 
identify 
security 
gaps 
and 
improve 
their 
security 
posture4. AWS WAF is an AWS service that helps protect web applications from common web exploits, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and bot attacks. AWS WAF does not apply security rules to specific Amazon EC2 instances, but it can be integrated with other AWS services, such as Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and Application Load Balancer. 

Question: 439 
Which actions are best practices for an AWS account root user? (Select TWO.) 
A. Share root user credentials with team members. 
B.. Create multiple root users for the account, separated by environment. 
C. DEnable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the root user. 
D. Create an IAM user with administrator privileges for daily administrative tasks, instead of using the root user. 
Use programmatic access instead of the root user and password. 

Answer: CD 
Explanation: The AWS account root user is the identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. It 
is 
accessed 
by 
signing 
in 
with 
the 
email 
address 
and 
password 
that 
were 
used 
to 
create 
the 
account1. The 
root 
user 
should 
be 
protected 
and 
used 
only 
for 
a 
few 
account 
and 
service 
management 
tasks 
that 
require 
it1. Therefore, the following actions are best practices for an AWS account root user: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the root user. MFA is a security feature that requires users to provide two or more pieces of information to authenticate themselves, such as a password and a code from a device. MFA 
adds 
an 
extra 
layer 
of 
protection 
for 
the 
root 
user 
credentials, 
which 
can 
access 
sensitive 
information 
and 
perform 
critical 
operations 
in 
the 
account2. Create an IAM user with administrator privileges for daily administrative tasks, instead of using the root user. IAM is a service that helps customers manage access to AWS resources for users and 
https://www.certshero.com 

groups. Customers can create IAM users and assign them permissions to perform specific tasks on specific resources. Customers 
can 
also 
create 
IAM 
roles 
and 
policies 
to 
delegate 
access 
to 
other 
AWS 
services 
or 
external 
entities3. By 
creating 
an 
IAM 
user 
with 
administrator 
privileges, 
customers 
can 
avoid 
using 
the 
root 
user 
for 
everyday 
tasks 
and 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
accidental 
or 
malicious 
changes 
to 
the 
account1. 

Question: 440 
A company wants an automated process to continuously scan its Amazon EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities. 
Which AWS service will meet these requirements? 
A. Amazon GuardDuty 
B. Amazon Inspector 
C. Amazon Detective 
D. Amazon Cognito 

Answer: B 
Explanation: Amazon Inspector is the AWS service that can be used to perform vulnerability scans on AWS EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities automatically in a periodic fashion. Amazon Inspector automatically discovers EC2 instances and scans them for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. Amazon Inspector uses AWS Systems Manager (SSM) and the SSM Agent to collect information about the software application inventory of the EC2 instances. This 
data 
is 
then 
scanned 
by 
Amazon 
Inspector 
for 
software 
vulnerabilities12. Amazon 
Inspector 
also 
integrates 
with 
other 
AWS 
services, 
such 
as 
Amazon 
EventBridge 
and 
AWS 
Security 
Hub, 
to 
automate 
discovery, 
expedite 
vulnerability 
routing, 
and 
shorten 
mean 
time 
to 
remediate 
(MTTR) 
vulnerabilities2. 

Question: 441 
Which AWS service can identify when an Amazon EC2 instance was terminated? 
A. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
B. AWS CloudTrail 
C. AWS Compute Optimizer 
D. Amazon EventBridge 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
https://www.certshero.com 

AWS CloudTrail is the AWS service that can identify when an Amazon EC2 instance was terminated. AWS CloudTrail is a service that records API calls and events for AWS accounts and resources. AWS CloudTrail can capture the TerminateInstances event, which is triggered when an EC2 instance is terminated by a user or an AWS service. The 
event 
contains 
information 
such 
as 
the 
instance 
ID, 
the 
user 
identity, 
the 
source 
IP 
address, 
the 
time, 
and 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
termination12. Customers 
can 
use 
the 
CloudTrail 
console, 
the 
AWS 
CLI, 
or 
the 
AWS 
SDKs 
to 
view 
and 
search 
for 
the 
TerminateInstances 
events 
in 
their 
event 
history 
or 
in 
their 
S3 
buckets 
where 
they 
store 
their 
CloudTrail 
logs13. 

Question: 442 
A company needs to categorize and track AWS usage cost based on business categories. 
Which AWS service or feature should the company use to meet these requirements? 
A. Cost allocation tags 
B. AWS Organizations 
C. AWS Security Hub 
D. AWS Cost and Usage Report 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
The AWS service or feature that the company should use to categorize and track AWS usage cost based on business categories is cost allocation tags. Cost allocation tags are key-value pairs that users can attach to AWS resources to organize and track their AWS costs. Users can use cost allocation tags to filter and group their AWS costs by categories such as project, department, environment, or application. Users 
can 
also 
use 
cost 
allocation 
tags 
to 
generate 
detailed 
billing 
reports 
that 
show 
the 
costs 
associated 
with 
each 
tag3. AWS Organizations, AWS Security Hub, and AWS Cost and Usage Report are other AWS services or features that can help users with different aspects of their AWS usage, such as managing multiple accounts, monitoring security issues, or analyzing billing data, but they do not enable users to categorize and track AWS costs based on business categories.

Question: 449 
A developer has been hired by a large company and needs AWS credentials. 
Which are security best practices that should be followed? (Select TWO.) 
A. Grant the developer access to only the AWS resources needed to perform the job. 
B. Share the AWS account root user credentials with the developer. 
C. Add the developer to the administrator's group in AWS IAM. 
D. Configure a password policy that ensures the developer's password cannot be changed. 
E. Ensure the account password policy requires a minimum length. 
Answer: AE 
Explanation: 
The security best practices that should be followed are A and E. 
A . Grant the developer access to only the AWS resources needed to perform the job. This is an example of the principle of least privilege, which means giving the minimum permissions necessary to achieve a task. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, or accidental damage to 
https://www.certshero.com 

AWS resources. You 
can 
use 
AWS 
Identity 
and 
Access 
Management 
(IAM) 
to 
create 
users, 
groups, 
roles, 
and 
policies 
that 
grant 
fine-grained 
access 
to 
AWS 
resources12. 
E 
. Ensure the account password policy requires a minimum length. This is a basic security measure that helps prevent brute-force attacks or guessing of passwords. A longer password is harder to crack than a shorter one. You 
can 
use 
IAM 
to 
configure 
a 
password 
policy 
that 
enforces 
a 
minimum 
password 
length, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
requirements 
such 
as 
complexity, 
expiration, 
and 
history34. 

B 
. Share the AWS account root user credentials with the developer. This is a bad practice that should be avoided. The root user has full access to all AWS resources and services, and can perform sensitive actions such as changing billing information, closing the account, or deleting all resources. Sharing the root user credentials exposes your account to potential compromise or misuse. You 
should 
never 
share 
your 
root 
user 
credentials 
with 
anyone, 
and 
use 
them 
only 
for 
account 
administration 
tasks5 
. 

C 
. Add the developer to the administrator・s group in IAM. This is also a bad practice that should be avoided. The administrator・s group has full access to all AWS resources and services, which is more than what a developer needs to perform their job. Adding the developer to the administrator・s group violates the principle of least privilege and increases the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, or accidental damage to AWS resources. You 
should 
create 
a 
custom 
group 
for 
the 
developer 
that 
grants 
only 
the 
necessary 
permissions 
for 
their 
role12. 

D 
. Configure a password policy that ensures the developer・s password cannot be changed. This is another bad practice that should be avoided. Preventing the developer from changing their password reduces their ability to protect their credentials and comply with security policies. For example, if the developer・s password is compromised, they cannot change it to prevent further unauthorized access. Or if the company requires periodic password rotation, they cannot update their password to meet this requirement. You 
should 
allow 
the 
developer 
to 
change 
their 
password 
as 
needed, 
and 
enforce 
a 
password 
policy 
that 
sets 
reasonable 
rules 
for 
password 
management34.

Snowmobile 
because 
you 
need 
to 
request 
multiple 
devices 
and 
transfer 
your 
data 
onto 
them

Question: 453 
A company wants to use the AWS Cloud to deploy an application globally. 
Which architecture deployment model should the company use to meet this requirement? 
A. Multi-Region 
B. Single-Region 
C. Multi-AZ 
D. Single-AZ 

Answer: A 
Explanation: The architecture deployment model that the company should use to meet this requirement is 
A . Multi-Region. A multi-region deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that distributes an application and its data across multiple geographic regions. A multi-region deployment model enables a company to achieve global reach, high availability, disaster recovery, and performance optimization. 
By 
deploying 
an 
application 
in 
multiple 
regions, 
a 
company 
can 
serve 
customers 
from 
the 
nearest 
region, 
reduce 
latency, 
increase 
redundancy, 
and 
comply 
with 
data 
sovereignty 
regulations12. A single-region deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that runs an application and its data within a single geographic region. A single-region deployment model is simpler and cheaper than a multi-region deployment model, but it has limited scalability, availability, and performance. A 
single-region 
deployment 
model 
may 
not 
be 
suitable 
for 
a 
company 
that 
wants 
to 
deploy 
an 
application 
globally, 
as 
it 
may 
face 
challenges 
such 
as 
network 
latency, 
regional 
outages, 
or 
regulatory 
compliance12. A multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that distributes an application and its data across multiple isolated locations within a single region. An Availability Zone is a physically separate location within an AWS Region that has independent power, cooling, and networking. A 
multi-AZ 
deployment 
model 
enhances 
the 
availability 
and 
durability 
of 
an 
application 
by 
providing 
redundancy 
and 
fault 
tolerance 
within 
a 
region34. A single-AZ deployment model is a cloud computing architecture that runs an application and its data within a single Availability Zone. A single-AZ deployment model is the simplest and most cost-effective option, but it has no redundancy or fault tolerance. A 
single-AZ 
deployment 
model 
may 
not 
be 
suitable 
for 
a 
company 
that 
wants 
to 
deploy 
an 
application 
globally, 
as 
it 
may 
face 
challenges

Question: 454 
Which option is a customer responsibility under the AWS shared responsibility model? 
A. Maintenance of underlying hardware of Amazon EC2 instances 
B. Application data security 
C. Physical security of data centers 
D. Maintenance of VPC components 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
The option that is a customer responsibility under the AWS shared responsibility model is B. Application data security. According to the AWS shared responsibility model, AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, while the customer is responsible for the security in the cloud. This 
means 
that 
AWS 
manages 
the 
security 
of 
the 
underlying 
infrastructure, 
such 
as 
the 
hardware, 
software, 
networking, 
and 
facilities 
that 
run 
the 
AWS 
services, 
while 
the 
customer 
manages 
the 
security 
of 
their 
applications, 
data, 
and 
resources 
that 
they 
use 
on 
top 
of 
AWS12. Application data security is one of the customer responsibilities under the AWS shared responsibility model. This means that the customer is responsible for protecting their application data from unauthorized access, modification, deletion, or leakage. The 
customer 
can 
use 
various 
AWS 
services 
and 
features 
to 
help 
with 
application 
data 
security, 
such 
as 
encryption, 
key 
management, 
access 
control, 
logging, 
and 
auditing12. Maintenance of underlying hardware of Amazon EC2 instances is not a customer responsibility under the AWS shared responsibility model. This is part of the AWS responsibility to secure the cloud. AWS 
manages 
the 
physical 
servers 
that 
host 
the 
Amazon 
EC2 
instances 
and 
ensures 
that 
they 
are 
updated, 
patched, 
and 
replaced 
as 
needed13. Physical security of data centers is not a customer responsibility under the AWS shared responsibility model. This is also part of the AWS responsibility to secure the cloud. AWS 
operates 
and 
controls 
the 
facilities 
where 
the 
AWS 
services 
are 
hosted 
and 
ensures 
that 
they 
are 
protected 
from 
unauthorized 
access, 
environmental 
hazards, 
fire, 
and 
theft14. Maintenance of VPC components is not a customer responsibility under the AWS shared responsibility model. This is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. AWS 
provides 
the 
VPC 
service 
and 
ensures 
that 
it 
is 
secure 
and 
reliable, 
while 
the 
customer 
configures 
and 
manages 
their 
own 
VPCs 
and 
related 
components, 
such 
as 
subnets, 
route 
tables,

Question: 458 
A company has 5 TB of data stored in Amazon S3. The company plans to occasionally run queries on the data for analysis. 
Which AWS service should the company use to run these queries in the MOST cost-effective manner? 
A. Amazon Redshift 
B. Amazon Athena 
C. Amazon Kinesis 
D. Amazon RDS 

Answer: B 
Explanation: Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive analytics service that allows users to run SQL queries on data stored in Amazon S3. It is ideal for occasional queries on large datasets, as it does not require any server provisioning, configuration, or management. Users only pay for the queries they run, based on the amount of data scanned. Amazon Athena supports various data formats, such as CSV, JSON, Parquet, ORC, and Avro, and integrates with AWS Glue Data Catalog to create and manage schemas. Amazon 
Athena 
also 
supports 
querying 
data 
from 
other 
sources, 
such 
as 
on-premises 
or 
other 
cloud 
systems, 
using 
data 
connectors1. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service that allows users to run complex analytical queries on petabyte-scale dat 
a. However, it requires users to provision and maintain clusters of nodes, and pay for the storage and 
https://www.certshero.com

Question: 464 
A company wants a list of all users in its AWS account, the status of all of the users' access keys, and if multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been configured. 
Which AWS service or feature will meet these requirements? 
A. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) 
B. IAM Access Analyzer 
C. IAM credential report 
D. Amazon CloudWatch 

Answer: C 
Explanation: IAM credential report is a feature that allows you to generate and download a report that lists all IAM users in your AWS account and the status of their various credentials, including access keys and MFA devices. You 
can 
use 
this 
report 
to

status 
of 
your 
IAM 
users 
and 
ensure 
that 
they 
follow 
the 
best 
practices 
for 
using 
AWS1. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a service that allows you to create and manage encryption keys to protect your dat 
a. It 
does 
not 
provide 
information 
about 
IAM 
users

Question: 465 
A company wants to make an upfront commitment for continued use of its production Amazon EC2 instances in exchange for a reduced overall cost. 
Which pricing options meet these requirements with the LOWEST cost? (Select TWO.) 
A. Spot Instances 
B. On-Demand Instances 
C. Reserved Instances 
D. Savings Plans 
E. Dedicated Hosts 

Answer: CD 
Explanation: 
Reserved Instances (RIs) are a pricing model that allows you to reserve EC2 instances for a specified period of time (one or three years) and receive a significant discount compared to On-Demand pricing. RIs are suitable for workloads that have predictable usage patterns and require a long-term commitment. You can choose between three payment options: All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront. The 
more 
you 
pay 
upfront, 
the 
greater 
the 
discount1. Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that can help you reduce your EC2 costs by up to 72% compared to On-Demand pricing, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one or three year term. Savings Plans apply to usage across EC2, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate. You can choose between two types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans and EC2 Instance Savings Plans. Compute Savings Plans offer the most flexibility and apply to any instance family, size, OS, tenancy, or region. EC2 
Instance 
Savings 
Plans 
offer 
the 
highest 
discount 
and 
apply 
to 
a 
specific 
instance 
family 
within 
a 
region2. Spot Instances are a pricing model that allows you to bid for unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud and are available at a discount of up to 90% compared to On-Demand pricing. Spot Instances are suitable for fault-tolerant or stateless workloads that can run on heterogeneous hardware and have flexible start and end times. However, 
Spot 
Instances 
are 
not 
guaranteed 
and 
can 
be 
interrupted 
by 

https://www.certshero.com 

AWS 
at 
any 
time 
if 
the 
demand 
for 
capacity 
increases 
or 
your 
bid 
price 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
current 
Spot 
price3. On-Demand Instances are a pricing model that allows you to pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments. On-Demand Instances are suitable for short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted, or for applications that are being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time. However, 
On-Demand 
Instances 
are 
the 
most 
expensive 
option 
among 
the 
four 
pricing 
models4. Dedicated Hosts are physical EC2 servers fully dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses, such as Windows Server, SQL Server, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Dedicated Hosts can be purchased On-Demand or as part of Savings Plans. Dedicated Hosts are suitable for workloads that need to run on dedicated physical servers or have strict licensing requirements. However, Dedicated Hosts are not the lowest cost option among the four pricing models. 

Question: 466 
A company wants an AWS service to provide product recommendations based on its customer dat a. 
Which AWS service will meet this requirement? 
A. Amazon Polly 
B. Amazon Personalize 
C. Amazon Comprehend 
D. Amazon Rekognition 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Amazon 
Personalize 
is 
an 
AWS 
service 
that 
helps 
developers 
quickly 
build 
and 
deploy 
a 
custom 
recommendation 
engine 
with 
real-time 
personalization 
and 
user 
segmentation1. It uses machine learning (ML) to analyze customer data and provide relevant recommendations based on their preferences, behavior, and context. Amazon 
Personalize 
can 
be 
used 
for 
various 
use 
cases 
such 
as 
optimizing 
recommendations, 
targeting 
customers 
more 
accurately, 
maximizing 
the 
value 
of 
unstructured 
text, 
and 
promoting 
items 
using 
business

Question: 467 
A company wants to launch multiple workloads on AWS. Each workload is related to a different business unit. The company wants to separate and track costs for each business unit. 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
A. Use AWS Organizations and create one account for each business unit. 
B. Use a spreadsheet to control the owners and cost of each resource. 
C. Use an Amazon DynamoDB table to record costs for each business unit. 
D. Use the AWS Billing console to assign owners to resources and track costs. 

Answer: A 
Explanation: AWS Organizations is a service that helps you centrally manage and govern your AWS environment. You 
can 
use 
AWS 
Organizations 
to 
create 
multiple 
accounts 
for 
different 
business 
units, 
and 
group 
them 
into 
organizational 
units 
(OUs) 
that 
reflect 
your 
organizational 
structure1. By 
doing 
so, 
you 
can 
separate 
and 
track 
costs 
for 
each 
business 
unit 
using 
the 
account 
ID 
as 
a 
cost 
allocation 
tag2. You 
can 
also 
use 
AWS 
Organizations 
to 
apply 
policies 
and 
controls 
to 
your 
accounts, 
such 
as 
service 
control 
policies 
(SCPs) 
and 
tag 
policies1. The other options are not suitable for meeting the requirements with the least operational overhead. Using a spreadsheet or a DynamoDB table to control and record costs for each business unit would require manual data entry and maintenance, which is prone to errors and inconsistencies. Using the AWS Billing console to assign owners to resources and track costs would also require manual tagging of each resource, which is time-consuming and inefficient. References:

Which AWS service provides a single location to track the progress of application migrations? 
A. AWS Application Discovery Service 
B. AWS Application Migration Service 
C. AWS Service Catalog 
D. AWS Migration Hub

Question: 474 
Which Amazon EC2 instan ce pricing model can provide discounts of up to 90%? 
A. Reserved Instances 
B. On-Demand 
C. Dedicated Hosts 
D. Spot Instances 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Spot Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that are available at a discounted price compared to On-Demand pricing. Spot Instances use spare EC2 capacity that is not being used by other customers, and the price fluctuates based on supply and demand. Customers can request Spot Instances for their applications and specify the maximum price they are willing to pay per hour. If the Spot price is lower than the customer・s bid, the Spot Instance is launched and the customer pays the current Spot price. However, if the Spot price rises above the customer・s bid, the Spot Instance is terminated by AWS and the customer is charged for the partial hour of usage. Therefore, Spot Instances can provide discounts of up to 90% or more, but they are not suitable for applications that require continuous or predictable availability. Spot 
Instances 
are 
recommended 
for 
applications 
that 
are 
flexible, 
fault-tolerant, 
or 
have 
low 
priority, 
such 
as

Question: 476 
A company has teams that have different job roles and responsibilities. The company's employees often change teams. The company needs to manage permissions for the employees so that the permissions are appropriate for the job responsibilities. Which IAM resource should the company use to meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead? 
A. IAM user groups 
B. IAM roles 
C. IAM instance profiles 
D. IAM policies for individual users 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
IAM roles are a way of granting temporary permissions to entities that need to access AWS resources, such as users, applications, or services. IAM roles allow customers to assign permissions to entities without having to create or manage IAM users or credentials for them. IAM roles can be assumed by different entities depending on the trust policy attached to the role. For example, IAM roles can be assumed by IAM users in the same or different AWS accounts, AWS services such as EC2 or Lambda, or external identities such as federated users or web identities. IAM roles can also be switched by IAM users to temporarily change their permissions. IAM roles are recommended for managing permissions for employees who often change teams, because they allow customers to define permissions based on job roles and responsibilities, and easily assign or revoke them as needed. IAM roles also reduce the operational overhead of creating, updating, or deleting IAM users or credentials for each employee or team change. 
Question: 477

https://www.certshero.com 

the data from accidental deletion or overwriting. Which S3 feature should the company use to meet these requirements? 
A. S3 Lifecycle rules B. S3 Versioning 
C. S3 bucket policies 
D. S3 server-side encryption 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
S3 Versioning is a feature that allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket. You can use S3 Versioning to protect your data from accidental deletion or overwriting by enabling it on a bucket or a specific object. S3 Versioning also allows you to restore previous versions of an object if needed. S3 Lifecycle rules are used to automate the transition of objects between storage classes or to expire objects after a certain period of time. S3 bucket policies are used to control access to the objects in a bucket. S3 server-side encryption is used to encrypt the data at rest in S3. References: S3

A. AWS DataSync 
B. AWS Application Migration Service 
C. AWS Application Discovery Service 
D. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
AWS Application Discovery Service is a service that helps you plan your migration to the AWS Cloud by collecting usage and configuration data about your on-premises servers and databases. This data includes information such as the hostname, IP address, and MAC address of each server, as well as the performance metrics, network connections, and processes running on them. You can use AWS Application Discovery Service to discover your on-premises inventory, map the dependencies between servers and applications, and estimate the cost and effort of migrating to AWS. You can also export the data to other AWS services, such as AWS Migration Hub and AWS Database Migration Service, to support your migration tasks. AWS Application Discovery Service offers two ways of performing discovery: agentless discovery and agent-based discovery. Agentless discovery uses a virtual appliance that you deploy on your VMware vCenter to collect data from your virtual machines and hosts. Agent-based discovery uses an agent that you install on each of your physical or virtual servers to collect data. You can choose the method that best suits your environment and needs. AWS DataSync is a service that helps you transfer data between your on-premises storage and AWS 
https://www.certshero.com 

storage services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. AWS DataSync does not collect information about your on-premises infrastructure, but rather focuses on optimizing the data transfer speed, security, and reliability. AWS Application Migration Service is a service that helps you migrate your applications from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS without making any changes to the applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers. AWS Application Migration Service does not collect information about your on-premises infrastructure, but rather uses a lightweight agent to replicate your servers as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and launch them as EC2 instances on AWS. AWS Database Migration Service is a service that helps you migrate your databases from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS, either as a one-time migration or as a continuous replication. AWS Database Migration Service does not collect information about your on-premises infrastructure, but rather uses a source and a target endpoint to connect to your databases and transfer the data.

Question: 493 
According to security best practices, how should an Amazon EC2 instance be given access to an Amazon S3 bucket? 
A. Hard code an IAM user's secret key and access key directly in the application, and upload the file. 
B. Store the IAM user's secret key and access key in a text file on the EC2 instance, read the keys, then upload the file. 
C. Have the EC2 instance assume a role to obtain the privileges to upload the file. 
D. Modify the S3 bucket policy so that any service can upload to it at any time. 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
According to security best practices, the best way to give an Amazon EC2 instance access to an Amazon S3 bucket is to have the EC2 instance assume a role to obtain the privileges to upload the file. A role is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don・t normally have access to your AWS resources. For example, you can create a role that allows EC2 instances to access S3 buckets, and then attach the role to the EC2 instance. This way, the EC2 instance can assume the role and obtain temporary security credentials to access the S3 bucket. This method is more secure and scalable than storing or hardcoding IAM user credentials on the EC2 instance, as it avoids the risk of exposing or compromising the credentials. It also allows you to manage the permissions centrally and dynamically, and to audit the access using AWS CloudTrail. For

The other options are not recommended for security reasons. Hardcoding or storing IAM user credentials on the EC2 instance is a bad practice, as it exposes the credentials to potential attackers or unauthorized users who can access the instance or the application code. It also makes it difficult to rotate or revoke the credentials, and to track the usage of the credentials. Modifying the S3 bucket policy to allow any service to upload to it at any time is also a bad practice, as it opens the bucket to potential data breaches, data loss, or data corruption. It also violates the principle of least privilege, which states that you should grant only the minimum permissions necessary for a task. References: Using

Question: 494 
What is the purpose of having an internet gateway within a VPC? 
A. To create a VPN connection to the VPC 
B. To allow communication between the VPC and the internet 
C. To impose bandwidth constraints on internet traffic 
D. To load balance traffic from the internet across Amazon EC2 instances 
https://www.certshero.com 


Answer: B 
Explanation: 
An internet gateway is a service that allows for internet traffic to enter into a VPC. Otherwise, a VPC is completely segmented off and then the only way to get to it is potentially through a VPN connection rather than through internet connection. An internet gateway is a logical connection between an AWS VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It 
does 
not 
cause 
availability 
risks 
or 
bandwidth 
constraints

Question: 496 
A company needs to migrate a PostgreSQL database from on-premises to Amazon RDS. Which AWS service or tool should the company use to meet this requirement? 
A. Cloud Adoption Readiness Tool 
B. AWS Migration Hub 
C. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) 
D. AWS Application Migration Service 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a managed and automated service that helps you migrate your databases from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS, either as a one-time migration or as a continuous replication. AWS DMS supports migration between 20-plus database and analytics engines, such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3. AWS DMS also provides schema conversion and validation tools, as well as monitoring and security features. AWS 
DMS 
is 
a 
cost-effective 
and 
reliable 
solution 
for 
database 
migration, 
as 
you 
only 
pay 
for 
the 
compute 
resources 
and 
additional 
log 
storage 
used 
during 
the 
migration 
process, 
and 
you 
can 
minimize 
the 
downtime 
and 
data 
loss 
with 
Multi-AZ 
and 
ongoing 
replication12 

To migrate a PostgreSQL database from on-premises to Amazon RDS using AWS DMS, you need to perform the following steps: Create an AWS DMS replication instance in the same AWS Region as your target Amazon RDS PostgreSQL DB instance. The replication instance is a server that runs the AWS DMS replication software and connects to your source and target endpoints. You 
can 
choose 
the 
instance 
type, 
storage, 
and 
network 
settings 
based 
on 
your 
migration 
requirements3 

Create a source endpoint that points to your on-premises PostgreSQL database. You need to provide the connection details, such as the server name, port, database name, user name, and password. You 
also 
need 
to 
specify 
the 
engine 
name 
as 
postgres 
and 
the 
SSL 
mode 
as 
required4 

Create a target endpoint that points to your Amazon RDS PostgreSQL DB instance. You need to provide the connection details, such as the server name, port, database name, user name, and password. You also need to specify the engine name as postgres and the SSL mode as verify-full. Create a migration task that defines the migration settings and options, such as the replication instance, the source and target endpoints, the migration type (full load, full load and change data capture, or change data capture only), the table mappings, the task settings, and the task monitoring role. You can also use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to convert your source schema to the target schema and apply it to the target endpoint before or after creating the migration task. Start the migration task and monitor its progress and status using the AWS DMS console, the AWS 
https://www.certshero.com 

CLI, or the AWS DMS API. You can also use AWS CloudFormation to automate the creation and execution of the migration task. The other options are not suitable for migrating a PostgreSQL database from on-premises to Amazon RDS. Cloud Adoption Readiness Tool is a tool that helps you assess your readiness for cloud adoption based on six dimensions: business, people, process, platform, operations, and security. It does not perform any database migration tasks. AWS Migration Hub is a service that helps you track and manage the progress of your application migrations across multiple AWS and partner services, such as AWS DMS, AWS Application Migration Service, AWS Server Migration Service, and CloudEndure Migration. It does not perform any database migration tasks itself, but rather integrates with other migration services. AWS Application Migration Service is a service that helps you migrate your applications from your on-premises or cloud environment to AWS without making any changes to the applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers. It does not support database migration, but rather replicates your servers as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and launches them as EC2 instances on AWS. References: AWS

A company wants to migrate its on-premises relational databases to the AWS Cloud. The company wants to use infrastructure as close to its current geographical location as possible. Which AWS service or resource should the company use to select its Amazon RDS deployment area? 
A. Amazon Connect 
B. AWS Wavelength 
C. AWS Regions 
D. AWS Direct Connect 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
AWS Regions are the AWS service or resource that the company should use to select its Amazon RDS deployment area. AWS Regions are separate geographic areas where AWS clusters its data centers. Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate Availability Zones within a geographic area. Each AWS Region is designed to be isolated from the other AWS Regions to achieve the highest possible fault tolerance and stability. AWS provides a more extensive global footprint than any other cloud provider, and to support its global footprint and ensure customers are served across the world, AWS opens new Regions rapidly. AWS maintains multiple geographic Regions, including Regions in North America, South America, Europe, China, Asia Pacific, South Africa, and the Middle East. Amazon RDS is available in several AWS Regions worldwide. To create or work with an Amazon RDS DB instance in a specific AWS Region, you must use the corresponding regional service endpoint. You can choose the AWS Region that meets your latency or legal requirements. You can also use multiple AWS Regions to design a disaster recovery solution or to distribute your read workload.

Question: 500 
An ecommerce company has migrated its IT infrastructure from an on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud. Which cost is the company's direct responsibility? 
A. Cost of application software licenses 
B. Cost of the hardware infrastructure on AWS 
C. Cost of power for the AWS servers 
D. Cost of physical security for the AWS data center 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
The cost of application software licenses is the company・s direct responsibility when it migrates its IT infrastructure from an on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud. Application software licenses are the agreements that grant users the right to use specific software products, such as operating systems, databases, or applications. Depending on the type and terms of the license, users may need to pay a fee to the software vendor or provider to use the software legally and access its features and updates. When users migrate their IT infrastructure to the AWS Cloud, they can choose to buy new licenses from AWS, bring their own licenses (BYOL), or use a combination of both. However, regardless of the option they choose, they are still responsible for complying with the license terms and paying the license fees to the software vendor or provider. AWS does not charge users for the application software licenses they bring or buy, but only for the AWS resources they use to run their applications. Therefore, the cost of application software licenses is the only cost among the options that is the company・s direct responsibility. The other costs are either included in the AWS service fees or covered by AWS. References: AWS

A company wants to receive a notification when a specific AWS cost threshold is reached. Which AWS services or tools can the company use to meet this requirement? (Select TWO.) 
A. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) 
B. AWS Budgets 
C. Cost Explorer 
D. Amazon CloudWatch 
E. AWS Cost and Usage Report 
Answer: BD 
Explanation: 
https://www.certshero.com 

AWS Budgets and Amazon CloudWatch are two AWS services or tools that the company can use to receive a notification when a specific AWS cost threshold is reached. AWS Budgets allows users to set custom budgets to track their costs and usage, and respond quickly to alerts received from email or Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications if they exceed their threshold. Users can create cost budgets with fixed or variable target amounts, and configure their notifications for actual or forecasted spend. Users can also set up custom actions to run automatically or through an approval process when a budget target is exceeded. For example, users could automatically apply a custom IAM policy that denies them the ability to provision additional resources within an account. Amazon CloudWatch is a service that monitors applications, responds to performance changes, optimizes resource use, and provides insights into operational health. Users can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables they can measure for their resources and applications. Users can create alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources they are monitoring when a threshold is breached. Users can use CloudWatch to monitor their AWS costs and usage by creating billing alarms that send notifications when their estimated charges exceed a specified threshold amount. Users can also use CloudWatch to monitor their Reserved Instance (RI) or Savings Plans utilization and coverage, and receive notifications when they fall below a certain level. References: Cloud

Which type of AWS storage is ephemeral and is deleted when an Amazon EC2 instance is stopped or terminated? 
A. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) 
B. Amazon EC2 instance store 
C. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) D. Amazon S3 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Amazon EC2 instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your EC2 instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content. It can also be used to store temporary data that you replicate across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. An instance store consists of one or more instance store volumes exposed as block devices. The size of an instance store as well as the number of devices available varies by instance type and instance size. The virtual devices for instance store volumes are ephemeral[0-23]. Instance types that support one instance store volume have ephemeral0. Instance types that support two or more instance store volumes have ephemeral0, ephemeral1, and so on. Instance store pricing Instance store volumes are included as part of the instance・s usage cost. The data on an instance store volume persists even if the instance is rebooted. However, the data does not persist if the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated. When the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated, every block of the instance store volume is cryptographically erased. Therefore, do not rely on instance store volumes for valuable, long-term data. If you need to retain the data stored on an instance store volume beyond the lifetime of the instance, you need to manually copy that data to more persistent storage, such as an Amazon EBS volume, an Amazon S3 bucket, or an Amazon EFS file system. There are some events that can result in your data not persisting throughout the lifetime of the instance. The

C. Network ACLs 
D. Amazon CloudWatch 
E. AWS CloudTrail 

Answer: AC 
Explanation: 
Security groups and network ACLs are two AWS services that can be used to block network traffic to an instance. Security groups are virtual firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic for your instances at the instance level. You can specify which protocols, ports, and source or destination IP addresses are allowed or denied for each instance. Security 
groups 
are 
stateful, 
which 
means 
that 
they

Question: 542 
Which AWS services or features give users the ability to create a network connection between two VPCs? (Select TWO.) 
A. VPC endpoints 
B. Amazon Route 53 
C. VPC peering 
D. AWS Direct Connect 
E. AWS Transit Gateway 

Answer: CE 
Explanation: 
VPC peering and AWS Transit Gateway are two AWS services or features that give users the ability to create a network connection between two VPCs. VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS Region. Traffic between peered VPCs never traverses the public internet. VPC 
peering 
does 
not 
support 
transitive 
peering 
relationships, 
which 
means 
that 
if 
VPC 
A 
is 
peered 
with 
VPC 
B, 
and 
VPC 
B 
is 
peered 
with 
VPC 
C, 
then 
VPC 
A 
and 
VPC 
C 
are 
not 
automatically 
peered789. AWS Transit Gateway is a networking service that acts as a regional router for your VPCs and on-premises networks. You can attach up to 5,000 VPCs and VPN connections to a single transit gateway and route traffic between them. AWS Transit Gateway simplifies the management and scalability of your network architecture, as you only need to create and manage a single connection from the central transit gateway to each connected network. AWS 
Transit 
Gateway 
supports 
transitive 
routing, 
which 
means 
that 
any 
network 
that 
is 
attached 
to 
the 
transit 
gateway 
can 
communicate 
with

Question: 552 
A company wants to run its workload on Amazon EC2 instances for more than 1 year. This workload will run continuously. Which option offers a discounted hourly rate compared to the hourly rate of On-Demand Instances? 
A. AWS Graviton processor 
B. Dedicated Hosts 
C. EC2 Instance Savings Plans 
D. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling instances 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
EC2 Instance Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that offer discounted hourly rates on Amazon EC2 instance usage for a 1 or 3 year term. EC2 Instance Savings Plans provide savings up to 72% off On-Demand rates, in exchange for a commitment to a specific instance family in a chosen AWS Region (for example, M5 in Virginia). These plans automatically apply to usage regardless of size (for example, m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge, etc.), OS (for example, Windows, Linux, etc.), and tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default) within the specified family in a Region. With 
an 
EC2

Question: 568

A company has a compute workload that is steady, predictable, and uninterruptible. Which Amazon EC2 instance purchasing options meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Select TWO.) 
A. On-Demand Instances 
B. Reserved Instances 
C. Spot Instances 
D. Saving Plans 
E. Dedicated Hosts 

Answer: BD 
Explanation: 
Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are the most cost-effective purchasing options for a compute workload that is steady, predictable, and uninterruptible. Reserved Instances provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instances, and Savings Plans offer flexible and consistent savings on EC2 usage. Both options require a commitment to a consistent amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years. On-Demand Instances are suitable for short-term, irregular, or unpredictable workloads, but they are more expensive than Reserved Instances or Savings Plans. Spot Instances are the cheapest option, but they are not suitable for uninterruptible workloads, as they can be reclaimed by AWS at any time. Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Instances are designed for compliance and licensing requirements, not for cost optimization. They are more expensive than the other options, as they run on single-tenant hardware. References: Instance

Which option is a customer responsibility when using Amazon DynamoDB under the AWS Shared Responsibility Model? 
A. Physical security of DynamoDB 
B. Patching of DynamoDB 
C. Access to DynamoDB tables 
D. Encryption of data at rest in DynamoDB 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
According to the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, while the customer is responsible for the security in the cloud. This means that AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services, such as DynamoDB, while the customer is responsible for properly configuring the security of the provided service. For 
abstracted 
services, 
such 
as 
DynamoDB, 
the 
customer 
is 
primarily 
responsible 
for 
managing 
their 
data, 
classifying 
their 
assets, 
and 
using 
IAM 
tools 
to 
apply 
the 
appropriate 
permissions12. Therefore, 
the 
customer 
is 
responsible 
for 
controlling 
the 
access 
to 
DynamoDB 
tables,

as 
by 
creating

https://www.certshero.com 

Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access only to the resources needed to perform a task is a concept known as: 
A. restricted access. 
B. as-needed access. 
C. least privilege access. 
D. token access. 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
The concept of granting access only to the resources needed to perform a task is known as least privilege access. This is a security best practice in IAM that helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized or malicious actions. By applying least privilege access, you can limit the permissions of your IAM users, groups, and roles to the minimum required for their specific tasks. You can also use conditions, permissions boundaries, and IAM Access Analyzer to further restrict and verify access. References: Security

Question: 577 
Which option is a benefit of the economies of scale based on the advantages of cloud computing? 
A. The ability to trade variable expense for fixed expense 
B. Increased speed and agility 
C. Lower variable costs over fixed costs 
D. Increased operational costs across data centers 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Economies of scale are the cost advantages that result from increasing the scale of production or operation. In cloud computing, economies of scale are achieved by pooling resources and sharing them among multiple users, which reduces the unit cost of computing and storage. One of the benefits of economies of scale in cloud computing is increased speed and agility, which means the ability to deploy applications faster and respond to changing business needs more quickly. Cloud computing allows users to access computing resources on demand, without having to invest in expensive infrastructure or wait for lengthy provisioning processes. This 
enables 
users 
to 
scale 
up 
or

Question: 579 
Which tasks are the customer's responsibility, according to the AWS shared responsibility model? (Select TWO.) 
A. Establish the global infrastructure. 
B. Perform client-side data encryption. 
C. Configure 1AM credentials. 
D. Secure edge locations. 
E. Patch Amazon RDS DB instances. 

Answer: BC 
Explanation: 
According to the AWS shared responsibility model, AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, while the customer is responsible for the security in the cloud. This means that AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud, such as the global network, the hardware, the software, and the facilities. The customer is responsible for properly configuring the security of the provided service, such as the guest operating system, the application software, the data, and the network traffic. For 
abstracted 
services, 
such 
as 
Amazon 
RDS, 
AWS 
operates 
the 
infrastructure 
layer, 
the 
operating 
system, 
and 
the 
database 
software, 
while 
the 
customer 
is 
responsible 
for 
managing 
their 
data, 
classifying 
their 
assets, 
and 
using 
IAM 
tools 
to 
apply 
the 
appropriate 
permissions12. Therefore, the tasks that are the customer・s responsibility are: Perform client-side data encryption: The customer is responsible for encrypting their data before sending it to AWS, and decrypting it after receiving it from AWS. This ensures that the data is protected in transit and at rest. AWS 
provides 
various 
encryption 
options, 
such 
as 
AWS 
Key 
Management 
Service 
(AWS 
KMS), 
AWS 
CloudHSM, 
and 
AWS 
Certificate 
Manager 
(ACM)3. Configure IAM credentials: The customer is responsible for creating and managing IAM users, groups, roles, and policies that control the access to AWS resources and services. IAM 
credentials 
include 
user 
names, 
passwords, 
access 
keys, 
and 
permissions4. The tasks that are not the customer・s responsibility are:

Question: 580 
Which Amazon EC2 pricing model is the MOST cost efficient for an uninterruptible workload that runs once a year for 24 hours? 
A. On-Demand Instances 
B. Reserved Instances 
C. Spot Instances 
D. Dedicated Instances 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
On-Demand Instances are the most cost-efficient pricing model for an uninterruptible workload that runs once a year for 24 hours. On-Demand Instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second, depending on which instances you run. No long-term commitments or up-front payments are required. You 
can 
increase 
or 
decrease 
your 
compute 
capacity 
to 
meet 
the 
demands 
of 
your 
application 
and 
only 
pay 
the 
specified 
hourly 
rates 
for 
the 
instance 
you 
use1. This 
model 
is 
suitable 
for 
developing/testing 
applications 
with 
short-term 
or 
unpredictable 
workloads2. The other pricing models are not cost-efficient for this use case. Reserved Instances and Savings Plans require a commitment to a consistent amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years. They 
provide 
significant 
discounts 
compared 
to 
On-Demand 
Instances, 
but 
they 
are 
not 
flexible 
or 
scalable 
for 
workloads 
that 
run 
only 
once 
a 
year12. Spot Instances are the cheapest option, but they are not suitable for uninterruptible workloads, as they can be reclaimed by AWS at any time. They 
are 
recommended 
for 
applications 
that 
have 
flexible 
start 
and 
end 
times, 
or 
that 
are 
only 
feasible 
at 
very 
low 
compute 
prices12. Dedicated Instances are designed for compliance and licensing requirements, not for cost optimization. They 
are 
more 
expensive 
than 
the 
other 
options, 
as 
they 
run 
on 
single-tenant 
hardware12. References: Amazon

A. Envision phase 
B. AIign phase 
C. Assess phase 
D. Mobilize phase 
E. Migrate and modernize phase 

Answer: AB 
Explanation: 
The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) is a tool that helps organizations plan and execute their cloud transformation journey. The AWS CAF defines four phases of the cloud transformation journey: Envision, Align, Launch, and Scale. Each 
phase 
has 
a 
specific 
purpose 
and 
outcome1: Envision: This phase helps you define your vision, goals, and expected outcomes for your cloud transformation. It 
also 
helps 
you 
identify 
and 
prioritize 
transformation 
opportunities 
across 
four 
domains: 
business, 
people, 
governance, 
and 
platform2. Align: This phase helps you identify capability gaps across six perspectives: business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations. It 
also 
helps 
you 
create 
strategies 
for 
improving 
your 
cloud 
readiness, 
ensure 
stakeholder 
alignment, 
and 
facilitate 
relevant 
organizational 
change 
management 
activities3. Launch: This phase helps you deliver pilot initiatives in production and demonstrate incremental business value. It 
also 
helps 
you 
learn 
from 
pilots 
and 
adjust 
your 
approach 
before 
scaling

Question: 597 
Which responsibility belongs to AWS when a company hosts its databases on Amazon EC2 instances? 
A. Database backups 
https://www.certshero.com 

B. Database software patches 
C. Operating system patches 
D. Operating system installations 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
When a company hosts its databases on Amazon EC2 instances, AWS and the customer share the responsibility for the security and management of the database environment. According to the AWS shared responsibility model, AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, while the customer is responsible for the security in the cloud. This means that AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs the EC2 instances, such as the hardware, software, networking, and facilities. The 
customer 
is 
responsible 
for 
properly 
configuring 
the 
security 
of 
the 
provided 
service, 
such 
as 
the 
guest 
operating 
system, 
the 
database 
software, 
the 
data, 
and 
the 
network 
traffic12. One of the tasks that belongs to AWS when a company hosts its databases on Amazon EC2 instances is operating system patches. AWS provides regular updates and patches to the operating system of the EC2 instances, which are applied automatically by default. The 
customer 
can 
also 
choose 
to 
manually 
apply 
the 
patches 
or 
schedule 
them 
for 
a 
specific 
time 
window3. Operating system patches are important for maintaining the security and performance of the EC2 instances and the databases running on them. The other tasks that belong to AWS when a company hosts its databases on Amazon EC2 instances are: Operating system installations: AWS provides a variety of operating system options for the EC2 instances, such as Linux, Windows, and Amazon Linux. The 
customer 
can 
choose 
the 
operating 
system 
that 
best 
suits 
their 
database 
needs 
and 
AWS 
will 
install 
it 
on 
the 
EC2 
instances4. Server 
maintenance: 
AWS 
performs 
regular 
maintenance 
and 
repairs 
on 
the 
physical 
servers 
that 
host 
the 
EC2 
instances, 
ensuring 
that 
they 
are 
in 
optimal 
condition 
and 
have 
adequate 
power, 
cooling, 
and 
network 
connectivity5. Hardware lifecycle: AWS manages the lifecycle of the hardware that supports the EC2 instances, such as replacing faulty components, upgrading equipment, and decommissioning old servers. The tasks that do not belong to AWS when a company hosts its databases on Amazon EC2 instances are: Database backups: The customer is responsible for backing up their data and databases on the EC2 instances, using tools such as Amazon S3, Amazon EBS snapshots, or AWS Backup. Database backups are essential for data protection and recovery in case of failures or disasters. Database software patches: The customer is responsible for applying patches and updates to the database software on the EC2 instances, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQL Server. Database software patches are important for fixing bugs, improving features, and addressing security vulnerabilities. Database software install: The customer is responsible for installing the database software on the EC2 instances, choosing the version and configuration that meets their requirements. AWS provides some preconfigured AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) that include common database software, or the customer can use their own custom AMIs. References:

Question: 600 
A company wants to migrate its applications to the AWS Cloud. The company plans to identity and prioritize any business transformation opportunities and evaluate its AWS Cloud readiness. Which AWS service or tool should the company use to meet these requirements? 
A. AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) 
B. AWS Managed Services (AMS) 
C. AWS Well-Architected Framework 
D. AWS Migration Hub 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) is a set of best practices, tools, and guidance that helps organizations get started with cloud technologies. AWS CAF helps organizations identify and prioritize transformation opportunities, evaluate and improve their cloud readiness, and iteratively evolve their transformation roadmap. AWS CAF groups its capabilities in six perspectives: Business, People, Governance, Platform, Security, and Operations. Each 
perspective 
comprises 
a 
set 
of 
capabilities 
that 
functionally 
related 
stakeholders 
own 
or 
manage 
in 
the 
cloud 
transformation 
journey1 

AWS Managed Services (AMS) is a service that operates AWS infrastructure on behalf of customers, providing a secure AWS Landing Zone, features that help meet various compliance program requirements, a proven enterprise operating model, on-going cost optimization, and day-to-day infrastructure management. AMS 
does 
not 
help 
customers 
identify 
and 
prioritize 
business 
transformation 
opportunities 
or 
evaluate 
their 
cloud

Question: 601 
A social media company wants to protect its web application from common web exploits such as SQL injections and cross-site scripting. Which AWS service will meet these requirements? 
A. Amazon Inspector 
B. AWS WAF 
C. Amazon GuardDuty 
D. Amazon CloudWatch 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
AWS WAF is a web application firewall service that helps protect web applications from common web exploits that could affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over which traffic to allow or block to your web applications by defining customizable web security rules. You 
can 
use 
AWS 
WAF 
to 
create 
rules 
that 
block 
common 
attack 
patterns, 
such 
as 
SQL 
injection 
or 
cross-site 
scripting, 
and 
rules 
that 
filter 
out 
specific 
traffic 
patterns 
you 
define1. AWS 
WAF 
also 
integrates 
with 
other 
AWS 
services, 
such 
as 
Amazon 
CloudFront, 
Amazon 
API 
Gateway, 
AWS 
AppSync, 
and 
AWS 
Load 
Balancer, 
to 
provide 
a 
comprehensive 
defense 
against 
web 
attacks2. Therefore, AWS WAF meets the requirements of the social media company, compared to the other options. The other options are not suitable for the social media company・s requirements, because: Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. However, 
Amazon 
Inspector 
does 
not 
provide 
a 
web 
application 
firewall 
service 
that 
can 
block 
malicious 
web 
requests3. Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3. Amazon GuardDuty analyzes and processes the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. However, 
Amazon 
GuardDuty 
does 
not 
provide 
a 
web 
application 
firewall 
service 
that 
can 
block 
malicious 
web 
requests4. Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. Amazon CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, and visualizes it using automated dashboards, alarms, and notifications. However, Amazon CloudWatch does not provide a web application firewall service that can block malicious web requests. References:

Question: 602 
Which AWS services or features provide disaster recovery solutions for Amazon EC2 instances? (Select TWO.) 
A. EC2 Reserved Instances 
B. EC2 Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) 
C. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots 
D. AWS Shield 
E. Amazon GuardDuty 

Answer: BC 
Explanation: 
The correct answer is B and C. EC2 Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots are two AWS services that provide disaster recovery solutions for Amazon EC2 instances. EC2 AMIs are preconfigured templates that contain the software configuration and data required to launch an EC2 instance. You can create AMIs from your running EC2 instances and use them to launch new instances in the same or different AWS Regions. This 
way, 
you 
can 
quickly 
recover 
your 
EC2 
instances 
in 
case 
of 
a 
disaster 
that 
affects 
your 
primary 
Region 
or 
Availability 
Zone1. Amazon EBS snapshots are incremental backups of your Amazon EBS volumes. You can create snapshots of your volumes and store them in Amazon S3, which is a highly durable and scalable storage service. You can use snapshots to restore your volumes to a previous point in time or to create new volumes from snapshots. Snapshots 
can 
also 
be 
copied 
across 
AWS 
Regions, 
enabling 
you 
to 
recover 
your 
data 
in 
another 
Region 
in 
case 
of 
a 
disaster2. The other options are not directly related to disaster recovery for EC2 instances: EC2 Reserved Instances are a pricing model that allows you to reserve EC2 capacity for a specific period of time and receive a discount on the hourly charge. Reserved 
Instances 
do 
not 
provide 
any 
disaster 
recovery 
benefits, 
as 
they 
are 
only

https://www.certshero.com 

C. Patch the operating system of Amazon RDS instances. 
D. Implement physical and environmental controls. 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
According to the AWS shared responsibility model, the customer is responsible for the security in the cloud, which includes configuring firewalls and networks. AWS provides security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) as firewall features that customers can use to control the traffic to and from their AWS resources. Customers are also responsible for managing their own virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and other network components. AWS

Question: 604 
A network engineer needs to build a hybrid cloud architecture connecting on-premises networks to the AWS Cloud using AWS Direct Connect. The company has a few VPCs in a single AWS Region and expects to increase the number of VPCs to hundreds over time. Which AWS service or feature should the engineer use to simplify and scale this connectivity as the VPCs increase in number? 
A. VPC endpoints 
B. AWS Transit Gateway 
C. Amazon Route 53 
D. AWS Secrets Manager 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
AWS Transit Gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your VPCs and on-premises networks through a central gateway. AWS Transit Gateway simplifies and scales the connectivity between your on-premises networks and AWS, as you only need to create and manage a single connection from the central gateway to each on-premises network, rather than individual connections to each VPC. You 
can 
also 
use 
AWS 
Transit 
Gateway

Question: 605 
A systems administrator created a new 1AM user for a developer and assigned the user an access key instead of a user name and password. What is the access key used for? 
A. To access the AWS account as the AWS account root user 
B. To access the AWS account through the AWS Management Console 
C. To access the AWS account through a CLI 
D. To access all of a company's AWS accounts 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
An access key is a pair of long-term credentials that consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. An access key is used to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK). An 
access 
key 
allows 
a 
user 
to 
access 
the 
AWS 
account 
through 
a 
CLI, 
which 
is

that 
enables 
users 
to 
interact 
with 
AWS 
services 
using 
commands 
in 
a 
terminal 
or 
a 
script12. The other options are not correct, because: To access the AWS account as the AWS account root user, a user needs the email address and password associated with the account. The root user has complete access to all AWS resources and services in the account. However, 
it 
is 
not 
recommended 
to 
use 
the

Question: 606 
A company is migrating to the AWS Cloud and plans to run experimental workloads for 3 to 6 months on AWS. Which pricing model will meet these requirements? 
A. Use Savings Plans for a 3-year term. 
B. Use Dedicated Hosts. 
C. Buy Reserved Instances. 
D. Use On-Demand Instances. 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
https://www.certshero.com 

On-Demand Instances are the most flexible and cost-effective pricing model for short-term, experimental, or unpredictable workloads on AWS. On-Demand Instances let you pay only for the resources you use, without any long-term commitments or upfront fees. You can easily start and stop instances as needed, and scale up or down depending on your demand. Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Dedicated Hosts are all pricing models that require a commitment for a certain amount of usage or capacity for a one-or three-year term. These pricing models offer lower prices than On-Demand Instances, but they are not suitable for workloads that only run for 3 to 6 months or have variable usage patterns. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances also offer flexibility to change instance types, sizes, or regions within the same family or pool, while Dedicated Hosts are physical servers that can only run specific instance types. 

Question: 607 
A user wants to allow applications running on an Amazon EC2 instance to make calls to other AWS services. The access granted must be secure. Which AWS service or feature should be used? 
A. Security groups 
B. AWS Firewall Manager 
C. IAM roles 
D. IAM user SSH keys 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to applications running on an Amazon EC2 instance to make calls to other AWS services. IAM roles are entities that have specific permissions policies attached to them. You can create an IAM role and associate it with an EC2 instance when you launch it or later. The applications on the instance can then use the temporary credentials provided by the role to access AWS resources that the role allows. This 
way, 
you 
do 
not 
have 
to 
store 
any 
long-term 
credentials 
or 
access 
keys 
on 
the 
instance, 
which 
reduces 
the 
risk 
of 
compromise 
or 
misuse12. The other options are not correct, because: Security groups are virtual firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic for your EC2 instances. Security

Question: 612 
Which AWS service or tool can be used to set up a firewall to control traffic going into and coming out of an Amazon VPC subnet? 
A. Security group 
B. AWS WAF 
C. AWS Firewall Manager 
D. Network ACL 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
A network ACL (NACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You can create a network ACL and associate it with a subnet to apply rules that allow or deny traffic to or from the subnet. Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that they evaluate the source and destination IP addresses for both inbound and outbound traffic. You 
can 
also 
use 
network 
ACLs 
to 
block 
IP 
address 
ranges 
that 
are 
known 
to 
be 
malicious12. The other options are not AWS services or tools that can be used to set up a firewall to control traffic going into and coming out of an Amazon VPC subnet. Security groups are another layer of security for your VPC that act as a firewall for your EC2 instances. Security groups are stateful, meaning that they automatically allow return traffic for allowed inbound traffic. Security 
groups 
can 
only 
filter 
traffic 
based 
on 
protocols, 
ports, 
and 
source 
or 
destination 
IP 
addresses,

Question: 613 
Which action is a security best practice for access to sensitive data that is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket? 
A. Enable S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) on the S3 bucket. 
B. Use IAM roles for applications that require access to the S3 bucket. 
C. Configure AWS WAF to prevent unauthorized access to the S3 bucket. 
D. Configure Amazon GuardDuty to prevent unauthorized access to the S3 bucket. 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Understanding IAM Roles: IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles in AWS are designed to delegate access permissions without sharing long-term security credentials. This means applications and services can use temporary security credentials, which enhances security. Why IAM Roles are Best Practice: Least Privilege Principle: By using IAM roles, you can ensure that applications only have the minimum permissions they need to function, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Temporary Credentials: Roles provide temporary security credentials, which reduce the risk if they are compromised compared to long-term access keys. Automated Rotation: Temporary credentials automatically expire and are rotated, which means you don・t have to manage the rotation manually. How to Implement IAM Roles: Create an IAM Role: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to IAM, and create a new role. Choose the type of trusted entity (e.g., EC2, Lambda). Attach Policies: Attach the necessary policies to the role that define the permissions for accessing the S3 bucket. Assign Role to Service: Attach the IAM role to your EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or other AWS services that need to access the S3 bucket. Use AWS SDKs: When accessing S3 from your application, use the AWS SDKs to automatically assume the IAM role and obtain temporary credentials. References:

Question: 626 
An ecommerce company has deployed a new web application on Amazon EC2 Instances. The company wants to distribute incoming HTTP traffic evenly across all running instances. Which AWS service or resource will meet this requirement? 
A. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling 
B. Application Load Balancer 
C. Gateway Load Balancer 
D. Network Load Balancer 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is the best choice for distributing incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic evenly across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. It operates at the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model) and is specifically designed to handle HTTP and HTTPS traffic, which is ideal for web applications. Here is why the ALB is the correct choice: Layer 7 Load Balancing: The ALB works at the application layer and provides advanced routing capabilities based on content. It can inspect the incoming HTTP requests and make decisions on how to route traffic to various backend targets, which include Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or Lambda functions. This is particularly useful for web applications where you need to make routing 
https://www.certshero.com 

decisions based on HTTP headers, paths, or query strings. HTTP and HTTPS Support: The ALB natively supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols, making it the ideal load balancer for web-based applications. It can efficiently manage and route these types of traffic and handle tasks such as SSL/TLS termination. Health Checks: The ALB can continuously monitor the health of the registered EC2 instances and only route traffic to healthy instances. This ensures high availability and reliability of the web application. Path-based and Host-based Routing: The ALB can route traffic based on the URL path or host header. This feature allows the same load balancer to serve multiple applications hosted on different domains or subdomains. Integration with Auto Scaling: The ALB can integrate seamlessly with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. As the number of EC2 instances increases or decreases, the ALB automatically includes the new instances in its traffic distribution pool, ensuring even distribution of incoming requests. WebSocket Support: It also supports WebSocket and HTTP/2 protocols, which are essential for modern web applications that require real-time, bidirectional communication. Why other options are not suitable: 
A 
. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: This service is used to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances up or down based on specified conditions. However, it does not provide load balancing capabilities. It works well with load balancers but does not handle the distribution of incoming traffic by itself. 

C 
. Gateway Load Balancer: This is designed to distribute traffic to virtual appliances like firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, or deep packet inspection systems. It operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) and is not ideal for distributing HTTP/HTTPS traffic to EC2 instances. 

D 
. Network Load Balancer: This load balancer operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) and is designed to handle millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. It is best suited for TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic but does not provide advanced Layer 7 routing features required for HTTP/HTTPS traffic. References:

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
AWS Trusted Advisor is a tool that helps customers optimize their AWS environment by providing real-time guidance in five key areas: cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits. However, the availability of the full set of Trusted Advisor checks depends on the AWS Support plan chosen. AWS Developer Support: This plan provides access to only seven core Trusted Advisor checks. It is designed for developers experimenting or testing in AWS and does not offer the full set of Trusted Advisor checks. 
https://www.certshero.com 

AWS Business Support: This plan is the lowest-cost support plan that provides access to the full set of AWS Trusted Advisor checks. Business Support is intended for production workloads, providing a broader range of checks, 24x7 access to Cloud Support Engineers, and more extensive support features. AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support: This plan offers access to all Trusted Advisor checks as well but is more expensive than the Business Support plan. It is designed for customers running production workloads and needing additional technical support but does not require the full level of engagement that comes with Enterprise Support. AWS Enterprise Support: This is the most comprehensive and highest-cost support plan, providing access to all Trusted Advisor checks and a full range of AWS Support resources, including a Technical Account Manager (TAM), account management, concierge support, and more. Conclusion: The correct answer is B. AWS Business Support, as it provides access to the full set of AWS Trusted Advisor checks at the lowest cost. AWS Developer Support does not offer the complete checks, and both AWS Enterprise On-Ramp and AWS Enterprise Support are higher-cost plans that also provide the full checks. AWS Cloud References:

Question: 629 
A company has data lakes designed for high performance computing (HPC) workloads. Which Amazon EC2 instance type should the company use to meet these requirements? 
A. General purpose instances 
B. Compute optimized instances 
C. Memory optimized instances 
D. Storage optimized instances 

Answer: B 
Explanation: 
For high performance computing (HPC) workloads, compute resources play a critical role in delivering the necessary processing power and efficiency. HPC workloads are typically computationally intensive, often requiring a large number of CPU cycles to solve complex problems. These workloads benefit most from instances that provide powerful processors and high clock speeds, which is why Compute optimized instances (Answer B) are the best choice in this scenario. Why Compute Optimized Instances (C Instances)? Designed for Compute-Intensive Tasks: Compute optimized instances in Amazon EC2, such as the C6i or C5 series, are designed to offer high compute performance, low cost, and consistent CPU power. These instances are ideal for workloads like HPC, which require a high level of processing per second. High Performance CPUs: The compute optimized instance family typically uses the latest-generation processors, such as AWS Graviton2 or Intel Xeon Scalable processors, which provide a higher number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) and increased clock speeds compared to other instance types. This matches the need for HPC workloads to maximize throughput and minimize compute times. Use Case Alignment: HPC workloads such as genomic research, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), financial modeling, and 3D rendering require high levels of CPU-bound tasks. Compute optimized instances provide the best CPU-to-memory ratio to handle these efficiently, leading to faster processing times and cost efficiency. Comparison with Other Instance Types: 
A 
. General Purpose Instances: These are versatile and balanced instances (e.g., T3 or M6i) that are suitable for various workloads but do not provide the specialized compute performance required for HPC. They offer a balanced mix of compute, memory, and networking but are not optimal for HPC workloads where computational power is critical. 

C 
. Memory Optimized Instances: While these instances (e.g., R5, X1) are ideal for memory-intensive workloads such as in-memory databases (e.g., SAP HANA) or real-time data analytics, they do not provide the specialized compute power necessary for HPC tasks that require heavy CPU processing. 

D 
. Storage Optimized Instances: These instances (e.g., I3, D3) are designed for workloads that need high disk throughput, like big data or transactional databases. While these are excellent for storage-heavy applications, they are not optimized for compute-intensive HPC workloads. Amazon EC2 Compute Optimized Family (C Instances) C6i Instances: Based on 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, C6i instances offer up to 15% better 


https://www.certshero.com 

price/performance compared to previous generation C5 instances. These are ideal for high compute and HPC workloads. C5 Instances: These are built for compute-intensive workloads like batch processing, distributed analytics, and high-performance web servers. They offer a high level of sustained CPU performance.

Question: 678 
A company needs stateless network filtering for its VPC. Which AWS service, tool, or feature will meet this requirement? 
A. AWS PrivateLink 
B. Security group 
C. Network access control list (ACL) 
D. AWS WAF 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
A Network Access Control List (ACL) is a stateless network filtering mechanism provided by AWS for controlling traffic in and out of subnets within a VPC. Unlike security groups, which are stateful, network ACLs are stateless. This means that they do not automatically allow responses to inbound traffic unless explicitly specified. Network ACLs allow you to set rules for both inbound and outbound traffic, making them suitable for stateless filtering. Security groups, on the other hand, are stateful, while AWS WAF is primarily for web application-level security. AWS PrivateLink is used for privately connecting VPCs to AWS services without using an internet gateway. Therefore, for stateless network filtering, Network ACL is the correct choice.

Question: 703 
A company is building a new application on AWS. The company needs the application to remain available if an individual application component fails. Which design principle should the company use to meet this requirement? 
A. Disposable resources 
B. Automation 
C. Rightsizing 
https://www.certshero.com 

D. Loose coupling 

Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Loose coupling is a design principle that involves reducing dependencies between application components so that they can operate independently. This approach ensures that the failure of one component does not affect the availability of the others, thereby improving the application's fault tolerance and resilience. Disposable resources, automation, and rightsizing are valuable principles in cloud architecture, but they do not directly address the requirement of remaining available despite the failure of an individual component like loose coupling does.

Question: 704 
Under the AWS shared responsibility model, which of the following is a responsibility of the customer? 
A. Shred disk drives before they leave a data center. 
B. Prevent customers from gathering packets or collecting traffic at the hypervisor level. 
C. Patch the guest operating system with the latest security patches. 
D. Maintain security systems that provide physical monitoring of data centers. 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Under the AWS shared responsibility model, AWS is responsible for the security "of" the cloud, which includes the physical infrastructure, networking, and hypervisor layer. The customer, however, is responsible for security "in" the cloud, which includes managing the security of their data, patching and maintaining their guest operating system and applications, and managing identity and access. The responsibilities of shredding disk drives, preventing packet capture at the hypervisor level, and physical monitoring are handled by AWS as part of its responsibility for security "of" the cloud. 

Question: 705 
A company is planning to migrate applications to the AWS Cloud. During a system audit, the company finds that its content management system (CMS) application is incompatible with cloud environments. Which migration strategies will help the company to migrate the CMS application with the LEAST effort? (Select TWO.) 
A. Retire 
B. Rehost 
C. Repurchase
